PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with measurable disease derived from histologically confirmed stage III/IV or recurrent endometrial carcinoma were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel plus cisplatin (DP), docetaxel plus carboplatin (DC), or paclitaxel plus carboplatin (TC) every 3 weeks until disease progression or adverse events prohibited further therapy. Among these regimens, the study evaluated the tumor response rate as the primary end point as well as toxicity. RESULTS: Ninety patients were enrolled. Of them, 88 were eligible and consequently 29, 29, and 30 patients were randomly assigned to DP, DC, and TC, respectively. Tumor response rates were 51.7%, 48.3%, and 60.0% in DP, DC, and TC, respectively (P = 0.65). The following toxic effects were observed: grade 3/4 neutropenia in 83.3%, 90.0%, and 76.6%; febrile neutropenia in 10.0%, 6.7%, and 3.3%; grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia in 6.7%, 10.0%, and 10.0%; grade 3/4 diarrhea in 13.3%, 3.3%, and 0%, respectively; and grade 3 neurotoxicity in 10.0% of TC.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation versus expectant management for couples with unexplained subfertility and an intermediate prognosis: a randomised clinical trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is commonly used as first-line treatment for couples with unexplained subfertility. Since such treatment increases the risk of multiple pregnancy, a couple's chances of achieving an ongoing pregnancy without it should be considered to identify those most likely to benefit from treatment. We aimed to assess the incremental effectiveness of intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation compared with expectant management in couples with unexplained subfertility and an intermediate prognosis of a spontaneous ongoing pregnancy. METHODS: 253 couples with unexplained subfertility and a 30-40% probability of a spontaneous ongoing pregnancy within 12 months were randomly assigned either intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for 6 months or expectant management for 6 months. The primary endpoint of this hospital-based study was ongoing pregnancy within 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the Dutch Trial Register and as an International Standard Randomised Clinical Trial, number ISRCTN72675518. FINDINGS: Of the 253 couples enrolled, 127 were assigned intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and 126 expectant management. In the intervention group, 42 (33%) women conceived and 29 (23%) pregnancies were ongoing. In the expectant management group, 40 (32%) women conceived and 34 (27%) pregnancies were ongoing (relative risk 0.85, 95% CI 0.63-1.1). There was one twin pregnancy in each study group, and one woman in the intervention group conceived triplets.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Efficacy of positive airway pressure and oral appliance in mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. <abs> The efficacy of currently recommended treatments is uncertain in patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI], 5-30). A group of 114 sleep clinic patients with an AHI of 5-30 have participated in a randomized controlled crossover trial of 3 months of treatment with each of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a mandibular advancement splint, and a placebo tablet. Outcomes were sleep fragmentation and hypoxemia, daytime sleepiness, quality of life, neurobehavioral function, and blood pressure. Both active treatments improved sleep outcomes, but positive airway pressure had a greater effect. The quality of life, symptoms, and subjective but not objective sleepiness improved to a similar degree with both treatments; however, many of the improvements seen in neuropsychologic function and mood were not better than the placebo effect. Some aspects of nocturnal blood pressure were improved with the splint but not with CPAP. This study has shown that although both CPAP and mandibular advancement splint effectively treated sleep-disordered breathing and sleepiness, the expected response in neurobehavioral function was incomplete. This may be due to the splint having a lesser therapeutic effect and CPAP being poorly tolerated and therefore used less in this patient group. <EV> <t> Efficacy and comorbidity of oral appliances in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea: a systematic review and preliminary results of a randomized trial. <abs> The obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a common sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by repetitive obstructions of the upper airway during sleep. The modification of pharyngeal patency by oral appliance therapy has been suggested as an alternative to various treatment modalities for OSAHS. To determine the evidence base with respect to the efficacy and comorbidity of the oral appliance therapy in OSAHS, a systematic review of the available literature was conducted.

Twenty-four patients diagnosed with OSA agreed to participate in this study. The patients were treated for 3 months (with a removable soft elastic silicone positioner customized with thermoplastic silicone and with a 5-mm opening). Patients were selected, using a randomized design, to receive an OA model either with (12 patients) or without advance (12 patients). Before treatment, a snoring questionnaire, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and polysomnography were completed. Fifteen subjects completed the protocol (13 men, two women). With respect to basal values, the mandible-advanced OA group presented a decrease in the mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (33.8+/-4.7 versus 9.6+/-2.1; p<0.01), number of arousals per hour (33.8+/-13.9 versus 16.0+/-1.5; p<0.05), ESS score (14.7+/-5.1 versus 5.1+/-1.9; p<0.05), snoring score (15.4+/-1.9 versus 10.1+/-3.2; p<0.05), and total FOSQ score (78.1+/-22.6 versus 99.3+/-14.4; p<0.05).

METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive monthly intraocular injections of 0.3 or 0.5 mg of ranibizumab or sham injections. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcome measure was mean change from baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) letter score at month 6. Secondary outcomes included other parameters of visual function and central foveal thickness (CFT). RESULTS: Mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) change from baseline BCVA letter score at month 6 was 12.7 (9.9-15.4) and 14.9 (12.6-17.2) in the 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg ranibizumab groups, respectively, and 0.8 (-2.0 to 3.6) in the sham group (P<0.0001 for each ranibizumab group vs. sham).

{"document": "<EV> <t> [Randomized clinical trial investigating three chemoprophylaxis regimens for latent tuberculosis infection in HIV-infected patients]. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the adherence to, and safety of three chemoprophylaxis regimens for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection in HIV-infected patients with a positive tuberculin skin test. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized, comparative, open clinical assay was carried out in 316 HIV-infected patients in 12 Spanish hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three regimens, 108 to isoniazid for six months (6H), 103 to rifampin and isoniazid for three months (3RH), and 105 to rifampin and pyrazinamide for two months (2RZ). After completion of treatment, patients were followed-up for two years. RESULTS: The period of observation following completion of treatment was 115, 108 and 101 person-years for 6H, 3RH and 2RZ, respectively. Twenty-seven percent of patients voluntarily abandoned chemoprophylaxis and 9.7% were withdrawn due to adverse side-effects or interactions. Seven patients were withdrawn due to hepatotoxicity (5 in 6H, 2 in 3RH and 0 in 2RZ). No appreciable differences were found among the three regimens. There were 11 cases of tuberculosis during follow-up. The TB rates (cases per 100 person-years) in the three treatment groups were 3.48 in 6H, 4.63 in 3RH and 1.98 in 2RZ. With respect to 2RZ, the relative risk for TB in the 6H and 3RH regimens was 1.76 and 2.34, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The safety of the 2RZ regimen for prophylaxis of latent TB infection in HIV patients was similar to that of the 6H and 3RH regimens. The incidence of hepatotoxicity was not higher in patients who received 2RZ. <EV> <t> Effect of tuberculosis preventive therapy on HIV disease progression and survival in HIV-infected adults. <abs> PURPOSE: To determine whether tuberculosis (TB) preventive therapies alter the rate of disease progression to AIDS or death and to identify significant prognostic factors for HIV disease progression to AIDS. METHOD: In a randomized placebo-controlled trial in Kampala, Uganda, 2,736 purified protein derivative (PPD)-positive and anergic HIV-infected adults were randomly assigned to four and two regimens, respectively. PPD-positive patients were treated with isoniazid (INH) for 6 months (6H; n = 536), INH plus rifampicin for 3 months (3HR; n = 556), INH plus rifampicin plus pyrazinamide for 3 months (3HRZ; n = 462), or placebo for 6 months (n = 464). Anergic participants were treated with 6H (n = 395) or placebo (n = 323). RESULTS: During follow-up, 404 cases progressed to AIDS and 577 deaths occurred. The cumulative incidence of the AIDS progression was greater in the anergic cohort compared to the PPD-positive cohort (p < .0001). Among PPD-positive patients, the relative risk of the AIDS progression with INH alone was 0.95 (95% CI 0.68-1.32); with 3HR it was 0.83 (95% CI 0.59-1.17); and with 3HRZ it was 0.76 (95% CI 0.52-1.08), controlling for significant baseline predictors. Among anergic patients, the relative risk of the AIDS progression was 0.81 (95% CI 0.56-1.15). Survival was greater in the PPD-positive cohort compared to the anergic cohort (p = .0001).

MEASUREMENTS: Weight change, quadriceps strength, gait speed, quality of life and health care utilization at completion of the 12-week intervention. RESULTS: At 12 weeks, all groups lost weight: nutrition -6.2% (-8.4, -4.0); resistance training -6.3% (-8.3, -4.3); nutrition and resistance training -4.7% (-7.4, -2.0); attention control -5.2% (-9.0, -1.5). Those receiving resistance training alone lost more weight than those receiving the combined treatment (P= 0.029). Significant weight loss was prevented if supplement was consumed for at least 35 days. Groups were no different at 12 weeks for any other outcome. CONCLUSION: Frail, undernourished older adults with a fall-related lower limb fracture experience clinically significant weight loss that is unable to be reversed with oral nutritional supplements. Those receiving a programme of resistance training without concurrent nutrition support are at increased risk of weight loss compared with those who receive a combined nutrition and resistance training intervention. In this high-risk patient group it is possible to prevent further decline in nutritional status using oral nutritional supplements if strategies are implemented to ensure prescription is adequate to meet energy requirements and levels of adherence are high. <EV> <t> Nutritional supplementation decreases hip fracture-related complications. <abs> Protein energy malnutrition is an important determinant of clinical outcome in older patients after hip fracture, but the effectiveness of nutritional support programs in routine clinical practice is controversial. We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial to determine if nutritional supplementation decreased fracture-related complications in a selection of otherwise healthy patients with hip fractures. Patients were randomized to intervention or control groups. The control group (n = 40) was given ordinary hospital food and beverage. The intervention group (n = 40) also was administered a 1000 kcal daily intravenous supplement for 3 days, followed by a 400 kcal oral nutritional supplement for 7 days. We recorded daily fluid and energy intake during the first 10 days of hospitalization and fracture-related complications up to 4 months. The total fluid and energy intake in the intervention group neared optimal levels. The control group received 54% and 64% of optimal energy and fluid intake, respectively. The risk of fracture- related complications was greater in the control group (70%) than in the intervention group (15%). Four patients in the control group died within 120 days postoperatively. The comprehensive balanced nutrition supplement resulted in lower complication rates and mortality at 120 days postoperatively. <EV> <t> Using dietetic assistants to improve the outcome of hip fracture: a randomised controlled trial of nutritional support in an acute trauma ward. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To examine how improved attention to nutritional status and dietary intake, achieved through the employment of dietetic assistants (DAs), will affect postoperative clinical outcome among elderly women with hip fracture. DESIGN: Open prospective randomised controlled trial, comparing conventional nursing care with the additional nutritional support provided by DA. SETTING: Thirty-eight bedded acute trauma ward in a teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: All but 11 of 344 consecutive admissions with acute nonpathological hip fracture were approached. Three hundred and eighteen (93%) agreed to inclusion. Sixteen were ineligible as they were immediately transferred to another acute ward, were managed conservatively or died preoperatively. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Postoperative mortality in the acute trauma unit. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative mortality at 4 months after fracture, length of stay, energy intake and nutritional status. RESULTS: DA-supported participants were less likely to die in the acute ward (4.1 versus 10.1%, P = 0.048). This effect was still apparent at 4 month follow-up (13.1 versus 22.9%, P = 0.036). DA-supported subjects had significantly better mean daily energy intake (1,105 kcal versus 756 kcal/24 h, 95% CI 259-440 kcal/24 h, P<0.001), significantly smaller reduction in mid-arm circumference during their inpatient stay (0.39 cm, P = 0.002) and nonsignificantly favourable results for other anthropometric and laboratory measurements.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Effect of a participatory intervention with women's groups on birth outcomes and maternal depression in Jharkhand and Orissa, India: a cluster-randomised controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Community mobilisation through participatory women's groups might improve birth outcomes in poor rural communities. We therefore assessed this approach in a largely tribal and rural population in three districts in eastern India. METHODS: From 36 clusters in Jharkhand and Orissa, with an estimated population of 228 186, we assigned 18 clusters to intervention or control using stratified randomisation. Women were eligible to participate if they were aged 15-49 years, residing in the project area, and had given birth during the study. In intervention clusters, a facilitator convened 13 groups every month to support participatory action and learning for women, and facilitated the development and implementation of strategies to address maternal and newborn health problems. The primary outcomes were reductions in neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and maternal depression scores. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN21817853. FINDINGS: After baseline surveillance of 4692 births, we monitored outcomes for 19 030 births during 3 years (2005-08). NMRs per 1000 were 55.6, 37.1, and 36.3 during the first, second, and third years, respectively, in intervention clusters, and 53.4, 59.6, and 64.3, respectively, in control clusters. NMR was 32% lower in intervention clusters adjusted for clustering, stratification, and baseline differences (odds ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.59-0.78) during the 3 years, and 45% lower in years 2 and 3 (0.55, 0.46-0.66).

The present study used a randomized, prospective design to evaluate the possible benefits of NPPV plus standard therapy versus standard therapy alone in patients admitted with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in a respiratory unit of a tertiary hospital. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Forty-one patients were included in the study. Of them, 20 were randomly allocated to receive NPPV with a standard mask connected to a BiPAP ventilatory assist device (Respironics Inc, Murrysville, PA) and 21 to standard therapy. Both groups had similar characteristics upon their admission in the hospital. RESULTS: The use of noninvasive ventilation significantly reduced the respiratory rates and improved the conscious level within the first 2 h (p < 0.001). There were significant differences in PaCO2 and pH (p < 0.05) at 6 h of treatment. The need for intubation was 5% in the NPPV group vs 14% in the control group.

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A sample of 173 women (and 194 infants) with high-risk pregnancies (gestational or pregestational diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, preterm labor, or high risk of preterm labor) were randomly assigned to the intervention group (85 women and 94 infants) or the control group (88 women and 100 infants).

{"document": "<EV> <t> Little effect of transfer technique instruction and physical fitness training in reducing low back pain among nurses: a cluster randomised intervention study. <abs> The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a transfer technique education programme (TT) alone or in combination with physical fitness training (TTPT) compared with a control group, who followed their usual routine. Eleven clinical hospital wards were cluster randomised to either intervention (six wards) or to control (five wards). The intervention cluster was individually randomised to TT (55 nurses) and TTPT (50 nurses), control (76 nurses). The transfer technique programme was a 4-d course of train-the-trainers to teach transfer technique to their colleagues. The physical training consisted of supervised physical fitness training 1 h twice per week for 8 weeks. Implementing transfer technique alone or in combination with physical fitness training among a hospital nursing staff did not, when compared to a control group, show any statistical differences according to self-reported low back pain (LBP), pain level, disability and sick leave at a 12-month follow-up. However, the individual randomised intervention subgroup (transfer technique/physical training) significantly improved the LBP-disability (p = 0.001). Although weakened by a high withdrawal rate, teaching transfer technique to nurses in a hospital setting needs to be thoroughly considered. Other priorities such as physical training may be taken into consideration. The current study supports the findings of other studies that introducing transfer technique alone has no effect in targeting LBP. However, physical training seems to have an influence in minimising the LBP consequences and may be important in the discussion of how to prevent LBP or the recurrence of LBP among nursing personnel. <EV> <t> Can a new behaviorally oriented training process to improve lifting technique prevent occupationally related back injuries due to lifting? <abs> STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized control trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine the degree to which a new behavior-based lift training program (LiftTrainer; Ascension Technology, Burlington, VT) could reduce the incidence of low back disorder in distribution center jobs that require repetitive lifting. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Most studies show programs aimed at training lifting techniques to be ineffective in preventing low back disorders, which may be due to their conceptual rather than behavioral learning approach. METHODS: A total of 2144 employees in 19 distribution centers were randomized into either the LiftTrainer program or a video control group. In the LiftTrainer program, participants were individually trained in up to 5, 30-minute sessions while instrumented with motion capture sensors to quantify the L5/S1 moments. Twelve months following the initial training, injury data were obtained from company records. RESULTS: Survival analyses (Kaplan-Meier) indicated that there was no difference in injury rates between the 2 training groups. Likewise, there was no difference in the turnover rates. However, those with a low (<30 Nm) average twisting moment at the end of the first session experienced a significantly (P < 0.005) lower rate of low back disorder than controls. CONCLUSIONS: While overall the LiftTrainer program was not effective, those with twisting moments below 30 Nm reported fewer injuries, suggesting a shift in focus for \"safe\" lifting programs. <EV> <t> Effects of a multifaceted minimal-lift environment for nursing staff: pilot results. <abs> Nursing staff are at risk for musculoskeletal injuries because of the physical nature of patient handling. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a multifaceted minimal-lift environment on reported equipment use, musculoskeletal injury rates, and workers' compensation costs for patient-handling injuries. The pilot study consists of a mixed measures design, with both descriptive and quasi-experimental design elements. The intervention consists of engineering (minimal-lift equipment), administrative (nursing policy), and behavioral (peer coach program) controls. The comparison nursing unit has received engineering controls only. The convenience sample includes nursing staff employed on two medical-surgical nursing units, who provide direct patient care at least 50% of the time. Nursing staff employed in a multifaceted lift environment report greater lift equipment use and experience less injury, with reduced worker's compensation costs. <EV> <t> Effect of nursing assistance tools on preventing musculoskeletal pain among staff in schools for disabled children. <abs> Objective is to clarify whether nursing assistance tools (a mat with attached handles, a pair of trousers with knee pads and a waist holding belt) prevent musculoskeletal pain, such as low back pain and upper arm pain, and depression, and improve the burden on the lower back and upper arm among staff in schools for disabled children. This study design was a non-randomized intervention trial. The subjects were 41 staff in two schools for disabled children in Japan. Nursing assistance tools were used with the intervention group to help with their nursing activities. We investigated the one-month prevalence of low back pain and the degree of burden on the lower back using a questionnaire at the baseline and at the end point 4 to 6 months later. The prevalence of low back pain did not change significantly in either group.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Predictive risk score for infection after inguinal hernia repair. <abs> BACKGROUND: Identification of subgroups of patients at high and low risk for global infectious complications (GIC) after inguinal hernia repair without mesh. METHODS: A database of 1254 patients who underwent inguinal hernia repair without mesh, issued from 3 prospective multicenter randomized trials, has been established (group A). After multivariate analysis, a score for GIC was calculated and tested using data from a similar prospective randomized multicenter study (group B). RESULTS: A risk score for GIC was constructed: -4.7 + (0.95 x age > or =75 years) + (1.1 obesity) + (2.1 x urinary catheter). In case of score less than -4.2 (low-risk group), the GIC rate was 2.7%; therefore, in case of score more than -4.2 (high-risk score), the GIC rate was 14.3% (P < .001). In the low-risk group, the administration of antibiotic prophylaxis did not reduce the infectious complication rate, while in high-risk group the administration of antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the rates of surgical site infection, GIC, and urinary infection by 72%, 67%, and 76.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in inguinal hernia surgery in the subgroup of high-risk patients. <EV> <t> The role of antibiotic prophylaxis in prevention of wound infection after Lichtenstein open mesh repair of primary inguinal hernia: a multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of prophylactic antibiotics is effective in the prevention of postoperative wound infection after Lichtenstein open mesh inguinal hernia repair. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: A recent Cochrane meta-analysis (2003) concluded that \"antibiotic prophylaxis for elective inguinal hernia repair cannot be firmly recommended or discarded.\" METHODS: Patients with a primary inguinal hernia scheduled for Lichtenstein repair were randomized to a preoperative single dose of 1.5 g intravenous cephalosporin or a placebo. Patients with recurrent hernias, immunosuppressive diseases, or allergies for the given antibiotic were excluded. Infection was defined using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. RESULTS: We included 1040 patients in the study between November 1998 and May 2003. According to the intention-to-treat principle, 1008 patients were analyzed. There were 8 infections (1.6%) in the antibiotic prophylaxis group and 9 (1.8%) in the placebo group (P = 0.82). There was 1 deep infection in the antibiotic prophylaxis group and 2 in the placebo group (P = 0.57). Statistical analysis showed an absolute risk reduction of 0.19% (95% confidence interval, -1.78%-1.40%) and a number needed to treat of 520 for the total number of infections. For deep infection, the absolute risk reduction is 0.20% (95% confidence interval, -0.87%-0.48%) with a number needed to treat of 508. CONCLUSIONS: A low percentage (1.7%) of wound infection after Lichtenstein open mesh inguinal (primary) hernia repair was found, and there was no difference between the antibiotic prophylaxis or placebo group. The results show that, in Lichtenstein inguinal primary hernia repair, antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated in low-risk patients. <EV> <t> A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for tension-free mesh herniorrhaphy. <abs> BACKGROUND: In recent years, use of prosthetic material for inguinal hernia repair has increased dramatically. Tension-free repairs have gained popularity not only for recurrent or complicated hernias, but for primary hernia repairs as well. Although routine use of prophylactic antibiotics is not recommended in the Philippines for open nonimplant herniorrhaphy, there is little direct clinical evidence on which to base recommendations when implantable mesh is used. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing wound infection rates in 360 patients (180 received prophylactic antibiotics, 180 received a placebo) undergoing primary inguinal hernia repair electively using polypropylene mesh. Age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, type of hernia, type of anesthesia, and duration of operation were recorded. Infections were evaluated 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month after operation by an independent surgeon. All complications were recorded. Results were assessed using chi-square, Fisher's exact test, and Student's t-tests as appropriate. RESULTS: Groups were well matched for all preoperative variables studied, including comorbid conditions. Six patients from the antibiotic group and four from the placebo group failed to followup after the second week. Superficial surgical site infection developed in 3 patients (1.7%) from the antibiotic group and 6 (3.3%) from the placebo group (p = 0.50). One from each group developed deep surgical site infection. Both patients were readmitted and underwent repeated debridement, which eventually resulted in graft loss. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative administration of single-dose antibiotic for tension-free inguinal mesh herniorrhaphy did not markedly decrease risk of wound infection in this patient population. Our results do not support use of antibiotic prophylaxis for tension-free mesh herniorrhaphy. <EV> <t> The role of antibiotic prophylaxis on wound infection after mesh hernia repair under local anesthesia on an ambulatory basis. <abs> Mesh prosthesis, local anesthesia, and ambulatory care have been widely introduced in recent decades in the treatment of inguinal hernia. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis during open inguinal hernia repair has been controversial. No prospective trial has been conducted to assess the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients operated on for inguinal hernia under the above-mentioned conditions. A prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial was initiated to assess the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in the prevention of wound infection during open mesh inguinal hernia repair under local anesthesia on an ambulatory basis. Ninety-nine consecutive hernia repairs were randomized to receive 1 g of parenteral Cefazolin preoperatively or a placebo. No wound infections existed in the therapeutic group (0/50). Four infections appeared in the control group (4/49), and the study was suspended for ethical reasons when differences reached values close to statistical significance ( P=0.059). We conclude that a single dose of intravenous Cefazolin decreases the risk of wound infection during open mesh inguinal hernia repair under local anesthesia on an ambulatory basis. <EV> <t> The role of antibiotic prophylaxis in elective tension-free mesh inguinal hernia repair: results of a single-centre prospective randomised trial. <abs> Hernia repair is one of the so-called clean operations. Many surgeons, however, use antibiotics, especially in the mesh repair era, without strong evidence to support this policy. We conducted a single-centre prospective randomised trial with a view to clarify this issue on a scientific basis. From January 2000 all patients undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair using a tension-free polypropylene mesh technique, provided they fulfilled predetermined criteria, were randomised to have a single dose of amoxicillin and clavoulanic acid or placebo in a double-blind manner. The main end point was to detect any difference in infectious complication rates - with specific interest to wound infection rates - between the two groups. Between January 2000 and June 2004, 386 patients entered the study (364 men and 22 women, median age 63 years, range 15-90 years) and were randomised to have antibiotic prophylaxis (group A, n = 193) or placebo (group B, n = 193). The two groups were comparable regarding demographic data. In total, 19 (5%) cases with infectious complications were detected. Fourteen of these were wound infections (3.7%). There were five cases of wound infection in group A and nine in group B (p = 0.4, Fisher's exact test). All wound infections were treated with antibiotics. The wound was opened in some cases. Mesh removal was not required in any of the cases. From the results of this study it does not appear that antibiotic prophylaxis offers any benefits in the elective mesh inguinal hernia repair.", "summary:reference": "Based on the results of this meta-analysis the administration of antibiotic prophylaxis for elective inguinal hernia repair cannot be universally recommended.

The current phase 3 study was planned to test the relative efficacy and safety of abciximab in patients with acute ischemic stroke with planned treatment within 5 hours since symptoms onset. METHODS: An international, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 3 trial tested intravenous administration of abciximab in 2 study cohorts using stratification variables of time since onset and stroke severity. The planned enrollment was 1800 patients. The primary cohort enrolled those patients who could be treated within 5 hours of onset of stroke. A companion cohort enrolled patients that were treated 5 to 6 hours after stroke as well as a smaller cohort of patients who could be treated within 3 hours of stroke present on awakening. The primary efficacy measure was the dichotomous modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months as adjusted to the baseline severity of stroke among subjects in the primary cohort. The primary safety outcome was the rate of symptomatic or fatal intracranial hemorrhage that occurred within 5 days of stroke. RESULTS: The trial was terminated prematurely after 808 patients in all cohorts were enrolled by recommendation of an independent safety and efficacy monitoring board due to an unfavorable benefit-risk profile. At 3 months, approximately 33% of patients assigned placebo (72/218) and 32% of patients assigned abciximab (71/221; P=0.944) in the primary cohort were judged to have a favorable response to treatment. The distributions of outcomes on the modified Rankin Scale were similar between the treated and control groups. Within 5 days of enrollment, approximately 5.5% of abciximab-treated and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients in the primary cohort had symptomatic or fatal intracranial hemorrhage (P=0.002). The trial also did not demonstrate an improvement in outcomes with abciximab among patients in the companion and wake-up cohorts. Although the number of patients was small, an increased rate of hemorrhage was noted within 5 days among patients in the wake-up population who received abciximab (13.6% versus 5% for placebo).

{"document": "<EV> <t> U.K. Controlled trial of intrapleural streptokinase for pleural infection. <abs> BACKGROUND: Intrapleural fibrinolytic agents are used in the drainage of infected pleural-fluid collections. This use is based on small trials that did not have the statistical power to evaluate accurately important clinical outcomes, including safety. We conducted a trial to clarify the therapeutic role of intrapleural streptokinase. METHODS: In this double-blind trial, 454 patients with pleural infection (defined by the presence of purulent pleural fluid or pleural fluid with a pH below 7.2 with signs of infection or by proven bacterial invasion of the pleural space) were randomly assigned to receive either intrapleural streptokinase (250,000 IU twice daily for three days) or placebo. Patients received antibiotics and underwent chest-tube drainage, surgery, and other treatment as part of routine care. The number of patients in the two groups who had died or needed surgical drainage at three months was compared (the primary end point); secondary end points were the rates of death and of surgery (analyzed separately), the radiographic outcome, and the length of the hospital stay. RESULTS: The groups were well matched at baseline. Among the 427 patients who received streptokinase or placebo, there was no significant difference between the groups in the proportion of patients who died or needed surgery (with streptokinase: 64 of 206 patients [31 percent]; with placebo: 60 of 221 [27 percent]; relative risk, 1.14 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.54; P=0.43), a result that excluded a clinically significant benefit of streptokinase. There was no benefit to streptokinase in terms of mortality, rate of surgery, radiographic outcomes, or length of the hospital stay. Serious adverse events (chest pain, fever, or allergy) were more common with streptokinase (7 percent, vs. 3 percent with placebo; relative risk, 2.49 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.98 to 6.36]; P=0.08). CONCLUSIONS: The intrapleural administration of streptokinase does not improve mortality, the rate of surgery, or the length of the hospital stay among patients with pleural infection. <EV> <t> Intrapleural streptokinase for empyema and complicated parapneumonic effusions. <abs> We conducted a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether streptokinase instillations adjunctive to chest tube drainage reduce the need for surgery and improve outcome in patients with pleural empyema. Fifty-three patients (frank pus aspirated, 81%; microbiological agent cultured, 62%; mean effusion pH, 6.6 +/- 0.4) received antibiotic treatment, chest tube drainage, and once-daily pleural rinses with either normal saline or normal saline with streptokinase (250,000 IU). Nine patients were excluded for various reasons before pleural rinses were started. Streptokinase (n = 22) was instilled over 4.5 +/- 2 days and saline (n = 22) was instilled over 3 +/- 1.3 days. One patient in each group died during treatment. Clinical treatment success and need for referral to surgery were the main outcome measures. No difference was observed after 3 days. After 7 days, streptokinase-treated patients had a higher clinical success rate (82 vs. 48%, p = 0.01) and fewer referrals for surgery (45 vs. 9%, p = 0.02). No significant radiologic or functional differences were observed between groups during follow-up over 6 months. We conclude that intrapleural streptokinase adjunctive to chest tube drainage reduces the need for surgery and improves the clinical treatment success in patients with pleural empyema. <EV> <t> Early use of intrapleural fibrinolytics in the management of postpneumonic empyema. A prospective study. <abs> OBJECTIVE: A prospective randomized study was conducted in order to analyze the role of fibrinolytics in the treatment of complicated parapneumonic effusion. METHODS: From 2001 to 2004, 127 consecutive patients were managed for thoracic empyema. In all cases the cause was bacterial pneumonia. Seventy patients were managed with sole tube thoracostomy (group A) and 57 with combination of tube thoracostomy and streptokinase instillation (group B). Groups were statistically compared for the age, gender, duration of symptoms, quality of pleural fluid, chest imaging, complete drainage, length of hospital stay and mortality. Multivariate analysis was used in order to define the factors that affect outcome. RESULTS: Tube thoracostomy was successful in 47 (67.1%) cases (group A), while fibrinolysis led to a favorable outcome in 50 cases (87.7%) (P<0.05). The length of stay in thoracic surgical department was significantly longer for group A (P<0.001). Mortality rate in group A was significantly higher (P<0.001). Multiple regression analysis disclosed as sole independent favorable factor for pleural drainage, the use of fibrinolysis during the course of chest tube drainage (P=0.006, odds ratio 4.29, 95% CI 1.51-12.14). CONCLUSIONS: Fibrinolytic agents are a useful adjunct in the management of complicated parapneumonic effusions. Intrapleural fibrinolytics, if used early in the fibrinopurulent stage of a parapneumonic effusion, decrease the rate of surgical interventions (VATS or open decortcation) and the length of hospital stay with minor associated morbidity.", "summary:reference": "Intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy confers significant benefit in reducing the requirement for surgical intervention for patients in the early studies included in this review but not in the more recently published Maskell study.

{"document": "<EV> <t> A randomized controlled trial of buprenorphine in the management of short-term ambulatory heroin withdrawal. <abs> AIM: To determine whether buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine and other symptomatic medications in managing ambulatory heroin withdrawal. DESIGN: Open label, prospective randomized controlled trial examining withdrawal and 4-week postwithdrawal outcomes on intention-to-treat. SETTING: Two specialist, out-patient drug treatment centres in inner city Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and fourteen dependent heroin users were recruited. Participants were 18 years or over, and with no significant other drug dependence, medical or psychiatric conditions or recent methadone treatment. One hundred and one (89%) participants completed a day 8 research interview examining withdrawal outcomes, and 92 (81%) completed day 35 research interview examining postwithdrawal outcomes. INTERVENTIONS: Participants randomized to control (n = 56) (up to 8 days of clonidine and other symptomatic medications) or experimental (n = 58) (up to 5 days of buprenorphine) withdrawal groups. Following the 8-day withdrawal episode, participants could self-select from range of postwithdrawal options (naltrexone, substitution maintenance, or counselling). MEASUREMENTS: Retention in withdrawal; heroin use during withdrawal; and retention in drug treatment 4 weeks after withdrawal. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Withdrawal severity; adverse events, and heroin use in the postwithdrawal period. FINDINGS: The experimental group had better treatment retention at day 8 (86% versus 57%, P = 0.001, 95% CI for numbers needed to treat (NNT) = 3-8) and day 35 (62% versus 39%, P = 0.02, 95% CI for NNT = 4-18); used heroin on fewer days during the withdrawal programme (2.6 +/- 2.5 versus 4.5 +/- 2.3, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 1-2.5 days) and in the postwithdrawal period (9.0 +/- 8.2 versus 14.6 +/- 10, P < 0.01, 95% CI = 1.8-9.4); and reported less withdrawal severity. No severe adverse events reported. CONCLUSIONS: Buprenorphine is effective for short-term ambulatory heroin withdrawal, with greater retention, less heroin use and less withdrawal discomfort during withdrawal; and increased postwithdrawal treatment retention than symptomatic medications. <EV> <t> Detoxification of opiate addicts with multiple drug abuse: a comparison of buprenorphine vs. methadone. <abs> Over the last few years, there has been a growing tendency for opioid addicts to abuse multiple drugs, although many patients are in substitution therapy with methadone. Abuse of multiple drugs leads to a more complicated withdrawal syndrome; it is therefore necessary to investigate new drug strategies as a treatment for detoxification. Buprenorphine appears to be an effective and safe drug in opioid-addicted patient detoxification. In this study, we have compared the short-term efficacy of an 11-day low-dose buprenorphine/14-day carbamazepine regime [BPN/CBZ] (n = 14) to an 11-day methadone/14-day carbamazepine regime [MET/CBZ] (n = 12) in a double-dummy, randomized 14-day inpatient detoxification treatment study. Twenty-six inpatients met the DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence and were included in this study. All patients abused various additional drugs. Fourteen of 26 patients (53.8 %) completed the study. Seven non-completers (seven of 12 = 58.3 %) were treated with methadone/carbamazepine and five non-completers (five of 14 = 35.7 %) received buprenorphine/carbamazepine, but the difference in the dropout rate was not significant. However, patients with buprenorphine/carbamazepine showed significantly fewer withdrawal symptoms after the first two weeks of treatment. The present study supports the hypothesis that buprenorphine/carbamazepine is more effective than methadone/carbamazepine in detoxification strategies for opioid addict with additional multiple drug abuse. No severe side effects occurred during treatment in either group. <EV> <t> Opioid detoxification using high doses of buprenorphine in 24 hours: a randomized, double blind, controlled clinical trial. <abs> In recent years, interest in shortening of opioid detoxification has increased with the rising demands to find more cost-effective approaches for treatment of opioid dependence. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of administration of high doses of buprenorphine during 24 h in the management of acute opioid withdrawal. A total of 40 treatment-seeking opioid dependents were admitted and randomly assigned to two groups in a double blind, parallel trial. Buprenorphine was administered intramuscularly. Twenty patients received 12 mg buprenorphine in 24 h and the remaining 20 patients treated with conventional doses of buprenorphine tapered down over 5 days. Variables that were assessed included retention in treatment, rates of successful detoxification, the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (OOWS) scores, the Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) scores, intensity of craving, drug side effects, and levels of hepatic enzymes (ALT and AST). There was no significant difference between the two groups on most variables. The main difference was in the time that maximal withdrawal symptoms occurred, which in the experimental protocol group appeared early while in the conventional protocol group appeared later during the detoxification period. Moreover, the experimental protocol was not only tolerated well but also accompanied with significantly less elevation in the ALT levels compared to the conventional treatment. However, patients in this group used more indomethacin and trazodone for symptom palliation. This study suggests that administration of high doses of buprenorphine in 24 h may be a reasonable approach for shortening of opioid detoxification. However, a larger study to confirm our results is warranted. <EV> <t> Opioid detoxification with buprenorphine, clonidine, or methadone in hospitalized heroin-dependent patients with HIV infection. <abs> With the growing role of intravenous drug use in the transmission of HIV infection, HIV-infected patients frequently present with comorbid opioid dependence. Yet, few empirical evaluations of the efficacy and consequences of opioid detoxification medications in medically ill HIV-infected patients have been reported. In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, we evaluated the impact of three medications on the signs and symptoms of withdrawal and on the pain severity in heroin-dependent HIV-infected patients (N=55) hospitalized for medical reasons on an inpatient AIDS service. Patients received a 3-day pharmacologic taper with intramuscular buprenorphine (n=21), oral clonidine (n=16), or oral methadone (n=18), followed by a clonidine transdermal patch on the fourth day. Observed and self-reported measures of opioid withdrawal and pain were taken 1-3 times daily for up to 4 days. Opiate administration used as medically indicated for pain was also recorded. Observer- and subject-rated opiate withdrawal scores decreased significantly following the first dose of medication and overall during treatment. Among all 55 subjects, self-reported and observer-reported pain decreased after treatment (on average observer-rated opioid withdrawal scale (OOWS) scores declined 5.6 units and short opioid withdrawal scale (SOWS) declined 4.8 units, P<0.001, for both) with no indication of increased pain during medication taper. There were no significant differences of pain decline and other measures of withdrawal between the three treatment groups. During the intervention period, supplemental opiates were administered as medically indicated for pain to 45% of the patients; only 34% of men versus 62% of women received morphine (P<0.05). These findings suggest buprenorphine, clonidine, and methadone regimens each decrease opioid withdrawal in medically ill HIV-infected patients.", "summary:reference": "Buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine for the management of opioid withdrawal.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Additive effects of dexamethasone in nebulized salbutamol or L-epinephrine treated infants with acute bronchiolitis. <abs> BACKGROUND: Although it is the most common lower respiratory infection of infancy, the optimal treatment for acute bronchiolitis is still controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the early and late effects of nebulized L-epinephrine (EPI) and intramuscular dexamethasone (DEX) combination therapy with nebulized salbutamol (SAL) and dexamethasone combination and bronchodilators alone in outpatients with acute bronchiolitis. METHODS: A total of 69 infants aged 2-21 months who were admitted to the Pediatrics Department of the Faculty of Medicine, Mersin University, with acute bronchiolitis were included in a randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective trial study. Patients were assigned to receive either nebulized L-epinephrine (3 mg) or salbutamol (0.15 mg/kg) and 15 min later, either dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg or placebo (PLA), intramuscularly, in a double-blind randomized fashion. The study groups were: epinephrine + dexamethasone group (group 1, n=23), salbutamol + dexamethasone group (group 2, n=23), epinephrine + placebo group (group 3, n=11), and salbutamol + placebo group (group 4, n=12). The outcome measures were heart rate, respiratory rate and Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI) score determined at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min, 24 h, and 5 days after the first therapy. Patients were then followed-up during the subsequent 2 months for the prevalance of respiratory complaints regarding bronchial hyperreactivity. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the outcome variables of the four groups within the first 120 min and at 24 hours, or between the rates of requirement of a second dose of the same bronchodilator. However, fifth day RDAI score values of both DEX groups were significantly lower than that of SAL + PLA group (P=0.000 and P=0.01, respectively). The fifth day score value of group 1 was also significantly better than that value of EPI + PLA group but not different from group 2. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of intramuscular dexamethasone added to nebulized L-epinephrine, or salbutamol therapies resulted in better outcome measures than bronchodilators alone in the late phase (fifth day) of mild to moderate degree bronchiolitis attack. However, effects of EPI + DEX combination was not different from SAL + DEX combination. <EV> <t> Epinephrine and dexamethasone in children with bronchiolitis. <abs> BACKGROUND: Although numerous studies have explored the benefit of using nebulized epinephrine or corticosteroids alone to treat infants with bronchiolitis, the effectiveness of combining these medications is not well established. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 800 infants (6 weeks to 12 months of age) with bronchiolitis who were seen in the pediatric emergency department were randomly assigned to one of four study groups. One group received two treatments of nebulized epinephrine (3 ml of epinephrine in a 1:1000 solution per treatment) and a total of six oral doses of dexamethasone (1.0 mg per kilogram of body weight in the emergency department and 0.6 mg per kilogram for an additional 5 days) (the epinephrine-dexamethasone group), the second group received nebulized epinephrine and oral placebo (the epinephrine group), the third received nebulized placebo and oral dexamethasone (the dexamethasone group), and the fourth received nebulized placebo and oral placebo (the placebo group). The primary outcome was hospital admission within 7 days after the day of enrollment (the initial visit to the emergency department). RESULTS: Baseline clinical characteristics were similar among the four groups. By the seventh day, 34 infants (17.1%) in the epinephrine-dexamethasone group, 47 (23.7%) in the epinephrine group, 51 (25.6%) in the dexamethasone group, and 53 (26.4%) in the placebo group had been admitted to the hospital. In the unadjusted analysis, only the infants in the epinephrine-dexamethasone group were significantly less likely than those in the placebo group to be admitted by day 7 (relative risk, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.95, P=0.02). However, with adjustment for multiple comparisons, this result was rendered insignificant (P=0.07). There were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Among infants with bronchiolitis treated in the emergency department, combined therapy with dexamethasone and epinephrine may significantly reduce hospital admissions. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN56745572.) <EV> <t> A randomized trial of nebulized epinephrine vs albuterol in the emergency department treatment of bronchiolitis. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To determine if nebulized epinephrine is more efficacious than nebulized albuterol in the emergency department (ED) treatment of moderately ill infants with bronchiolitis. METHODS: Sixty-six patients between 0 and 12 months of age with new-onset wheezing, an antecedent upper respiratory tract infection, and a clinical score (Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument) of 8 to 15 were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either 0.9 mg/kg of nebulized 2.25% racemic epinephrine (n = 34) or 0.15 mg/kg of nebulized 0.5% albuterol sulfate (n = 32) at 0, 30, and 60 minutes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were clinical score and respiratory rate. Secondary outcome measures were room air oxygen saturation, elapsed time to meeting clinical criteria for ED discharge, hospitalization rate, and proportion of patients relapsed within 72 hours of ED discharge (relapse rate). RESULTS: Both treatment groups experienced a similar pattern of change in mean clinical score, respiratory rate, and room air saturation over time. There were no significant differences between the groups by these same measures at any time. The median time at which infants were well enough for ED discharge was 90 minutes in the epinephrine-treated group vs 120 minutes in the albuterol-treated group (P =.01). Sixteen infants (47.1%) in the epinephrine-treated group were hospitalized compared with 12 infants (37.5%) in the albuterol-treated group (relative risk, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-2.22). Relapse rate was 18.8% (3/16) in the epinephrine-treated group and 42.1% (8/19) in the albuterol-treated group (relative risk, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-1.41). Adverse effects occurred infrequently. CONCLUSIONS: Although the patients treated with epinephrine were judged well enough for ED discharge significantly earlier than the patients treated with albuterol, epinephrine was not found to be more efficacious than albuterol in treating moderately ill infants with bronchiolitis. <EV> <t> Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of albuterol and epinephrine at equipotent beta-2 agonist doses in acute bronchiolitis. <abs> Our objective was to determine if nebulized racemic epinephrine is more efficacious than nebulized albuterol or saline placebo in the treatment of bronchiolitis in the outpatient setting when dosing is equivalent in terms of beta-2 agonist potency. Sixty-five patients between ages 6 weeks and 24 months with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis, defined as first-time wheezing, upper respiratory symptoms and/or fever, and a Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument score of at least 4, were randomized to receive 5 mg nebulized albuterol, 5 mg nebulized racemic epinephrine, or an equivalent volume of placebo at 0, 30, and 60 min. The primary outcome measure was need for hospital admission or home oxygen. Secondary outcome measures were changes in clinical scores and oxygen saturations. There were no significant statistical differences between groups in terms of need for hospital admission or outpatient management with home oxygen therapy. There were no differences between groups in terms of changes in clinical scores or oxygen saturations. Racemic epinephrine and albuterol at equivalent doses had no effect on the need for hospitalization or supplemental oxygen in bronchiolitis in the outpatient setting compared to nebulized saline placebo, though this study may have missed less dramatic clinical effects due to small sample size. <EV> <t> High volume normal saline alone is as effective as nebulized salbutamol-normal saline, epinephrine-normal saline, and 3% saline in mild bronchiolitis. <abs> The objective of this study was to investigate the effectivenesses of nebulized salbutamol, epinephrin, 3% saline, and normal saline (0.9% NaCl) in the treatment of mildly affected infants with acute bronchiolitis. We enrolled 186 children (mean age 9.5 +/- 5.3 months, range 1.5-24 months, 65.1% male) with a first episode of wheezing diagnosed as mild bronchiolitis in emergency department. Patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive 4 ml dose either of 1.5 mg epinephrine plus normal saline (group 1; n = 38) or 1.5 mg epinephrine plus 3% saline (group 2; n = 39) or 2.5 mg salbutamol plus normal saline (group 3; n = 36) or 2.5 mg salbutamol plus 3% saline (group 4; n = 36) or normal saline alone (group 5; n = 37) at 0 and 30 min. Thus, all treatment modalities included high amount of NaCl (72-240 mg). Clinical score, oxygen saturation and heart rate were assessed at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min. After discharge, patients were reassessed by telephone contact at 48 hr and 6 months. The baseline characteristics were similar in all groups (P > 0.05). The outcome of patients at 120 min was found significantly better than the baseline values (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the outcome variables of the groups (P > 0.05). No adverse effects attributable to nebulized therapy were seen. In conclusion, all treatment modalities used in this study, including a total of 8 ml normal saline inhalation at 30-min interval showed clinically significant and swift improvement in mildly affected ambulatory infants with acute bronchiolitis. <EV> <t> Comparative efficacy of combined nebulized salbutamol with ipratropium bromide and nebulized adrenaline to treat children with acute bronchiolitis. <abs> As the efficacy of combined nebulized salbutamol & ipratropium bromide as well as L-adrenaline to treat acute bronchiolitis is not well studied among the Bangladeshi infants, this study was carried out to see their efficacy in acute bronchiolitis and to compare their effectiveness. This randomized clinical trial was done among 60 children aged less than 02 years, admitted in the department of Pediatrics, Dhaka Medical College Hospital, during January through December 2005 with acute bronchiolitis. After a quick initial assessment, nebulization were done twice at 6 hours interval with the mentioned drugs, group wise (one group with salbutamol plus ipratropium bromide and other group with L-adrenaline alone) and the outcomes were assessed after 30 minutes of each nebulization in respect to oxygen saturation and clinical modified respiratory distress assessment instrument (MRDAI) scores.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Pyronaridine-artesunate versus chloroquine in patients with acute Plasmodium vivax malaria: a randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: New antimalarials are needed for P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria. This study compared the efficacy and safety of pyronaridine-artesunate with that of chloroquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This phase III randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority trial included five centers across Cambodia, Thailand, India, and Indonesia. In a double-dummy design, patients (aged >3-</= 60 years) with microscopically confirmed P. vivax mono-infection were randomized (1:1) to receive pyronaridine-artesunate (target dose 7.2:2.4 mg/kg to 13.8:4.6 mg/kg) or chloroquine (standard dose) once daily for three days. Each treatment group included 228 randomized patients. Outcomes for the primary endpoint, Day-14 cure rate in the per-protocol population, were 99.5%, (217/218; 95%CI 97.5, 100) with pyronaridine-artesunate and 100% (209/209; 95%CI 98.3, 100) with chloroquine. Pyronaridine was non-inferior to chloroquine: treatment difference -0.5% (95%CI -2.6, 1.4), i.e., the lower limit of the 2-sided 95%CI for the treatment difference was greater than -10%. Pyronaridine-artesunate cure rates were non-inferior to chloroquine for Days 21, 28, 35 and 42. Parasite clearance time was shorter with pyronaridine-artesunate (median 23.0 h) versus chloroquine (32.0 h; p<0.0001), as was fever clearance time (median 15.9 h and 23.8 h, respectively; p = 0.0017). Kaplan-Meier estimates of post-baseline P. falciparum infection incidence until Day 42 were 2.5% with pyronaridine-artesunate, 6.1% with chloroquine (p = 0.048, log-rank test). Post-baseline P. vivax or P. falciparum infection incidence until Day 42 was 6.8% and 12.4%, respectively (p = 0.022, log rank test). There were no deaths. Adverse events occurred in 92/228 (40.4%) patients with pyronaridine-artesunate and 72/228 (31.6%) with chloroquine. Mild and transient increases in hepatic enzymes were observed for pyronaridine-artesunate. CONCLUSION: Pyronaridine-artesunate efficacy in acute uncomplicated P. vivax malaria was at least that of chloroquine. As pyronaridine-artesunate is also efficacious against P. falciparum malaria, this combination has potential utility as a global antimalarial drug.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Resuscitation with hydroxyethyl starch improves renal function and lactate clearance in penetrating trauma in a randomized controlled study: the FIRST trial (Fluids in Resuscitation of Severe Trauma). <abs> BACKGROUND: The role of fluids in trauma resuscitation is controversial. We compared resuscitation with 0.9% saline vs hydroxyethyl starch, HES 130/0.4, in severe trauma with respect to resuscitation, fluid volume, gastrointestinal recovery, renal function, and blood product requirements. METHODS: Randomized, controlled, double-blind study of severely injured patients requiring >3 litres of fluid resuscitation. Blunt and penetrating trauma were randomized separately. Patients were followed up for 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients were randomized; of which, 109 were studied. For patients with penetrating trauma (n=67), the mean (sd) fluid requirements were 5.1 (2.7) litres in the HES group and 7.4 (4.3) litres in the saline group (P<0.001). In blunt trauma (n=42), there was no difference in study fluid requirements, but the HES group required significantly more blood products [packed red blood cell volumes 2943 (1628) vs 1473 (1071) ml, P=0.005] and was more severely injured than the saline group (median injury severity score 29.5 vs 18; P=0.01). Haemodynamic data were similar, but, in the penetrating group, plasma lactate concentrations were lower over the first 4 h (P=0.029) and on day 1 with HES than with saline [2.1 (1.4) vs 3.2 (2.2) mmol litre(-)(1); P=0.017]. There was no difference between any groups in time to recovery of bowel function or mortality. In penetrating trauma, renal injury occurred more frequently in the saline group than the HES group (16% vs 0%; P=0.018). In penetrating trauma, maximum sequential organ function scores were lower with HES than with saline (median 2.4 vs 4.5, P=0.012). No differences were seen in safety measures in the blunt trauma patients. CONCLUSIONS: In penetrating trauma, HES provided significantly better lactate clearance and less renal injury than saline. No firm conclusions could be drawn for blunt trauma. STUDY REGISTRATION: ISRCTN 42061860. <EV> <t> [The study of hypertonic saline and hydroxyethyl starch treating severe sepsis]. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of 7.5% hypertonic saline (HS) and 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4 on early fluid resuscitation for severe sepsis. METHODS: Prospective randomized control trial was carried out in intensive care unit (ICU) of the Affiliated Hospital of Jianghan University. One hundred and thirty five patients with severe sepsis were randomly divided into three groups, each group consisted of 45 patients. Patients in HS+HES group received lactated Ringer solution following 4 ml/kg of 7.5% HS and 6% HES 130/0.4 500 ml, those in HES group received lactated Ringer solution following 6% HES 130/0.4 500 ml, and those in the lactated Ringer group (RL group) received lactated Ringer solution only.Mean arterial pressure (MAP), oxygenation index (PaO(2)/FiO(2)),arterial lactate (Lac),lactate clearance rate, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II(APACHEII) score,fluid infusion volume, urine output as well as incidence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and mortality were compared among three groups at 6 hours and 24 hours after ICU admission. RESULTS: At 6 hours after ICU admission,MAP[mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa): 68.7 +/- 3.0], PaO(2)/FiO(2)(mm Hg: 262.2 +/- 17.4), lactate clearance rate [(21 +/- 4)%] in HS+HES group were significantly higher than those in HES group [MAP: 63.8 +/- 3.5,PaO(2)/FiO(2): 252.0 +/- 21.2, lactate clearance rate: (11 +/- 2)%] and RL group [MAP: 62.6 +/- 3.6, PaO(2)/FiO(2):248.4 +/- 17.0,lactate clearance rate: (9 +/- 1)%, all P <0.01]. Arterial Lac in HS+HES group (mmol/L: 3.5 +/- 0.7) was significantly lower than that in HES group (4.1 +/- 0.7) and RL group (4.0 +/- 0.7, both P <0.01). There was no significant difference in APACHE II score between HS+HES group (13.2 +/- 1.9) and HES group (14.0 +/- 1.6), and the APACHEII score in HS+HES group was significantly lower than that in RL group (15.2 +/- 1.7, P <0.01). At 24 hours after ICU admission, PaO(2)/FiO(2) (mm Hg: 303.3 +/- 17.3) was significantly higher in HS+HES group than that in HES group (282.9 +/- 21.1) and RL group (268.9 +/- 15.2, both P <0.01). There was no significant difference in MAP, arterial Lac, lactate clearance rate and APACHEII score among three groups. At 6 hours and 24 hours after ICU admission, fluid infusion volume in HS+HES group (ml, 6 hours: 1 877.8 +/- 215.2, 24 hours: 5 475.6 +/- 208.8) was markedly less than that in HES group (6 hours: 2 505.6 +/- 276.2, 24 hours: 6 383.3 +/- 287.4) and RL group (6 hours: 3 496.7 +/- 325.5,24 hours: 7 439.6 +/- 229.6), yet urine output in HS+HES group (ml, 6 hours: 294.2 +/- 36.9, 24 hours : 2 793.8 +/- 37.1) was significantly higher than that in HES group (6 hours: 248.9 +/- 25.3, 24 hours : 2 248.9 +/- 25.3) and RL group (6 hours: 178.9 +/- 14.8, 24 hours: 2 000.4 +/- 147.0, all P <0.01). The incidence of MODS in HS+HES group (6.7%) was statistically lower than that in RL group (28.9%, P <0.05), while no obvious difference was found between HS+HES group and HES group (17.8%, P >0.05). There was no significant difference in mortality among three groups (HS+HES group: 2.2%, HES group: 4.4%, RL group: 8.9%, all P >0.05). CONCLUSION: 7.5%HS and 6%HES 130/0.4 could improve the effect of early fluid resuscitation on severe sepsis, and it could lower the incidence of MODS. <EV> <t> Mortality after fluid bolus in African children with severe infection. <abs> BACKGROUND: The role of fluid resuscitation in the treatment of children with shock and life-threatening infections who live in resource-limited settings is not established. METHODS: We randomly assigned children with severe febrile illness and impaired perfusion to receive boluses of 20 to 40 ml of 5% albumin solution (albumin-bolus group) or 0.9% saline solution (saline-bolus group) per kilogram of body weight or no bolus (control group) at the time of admission to a hospital in Uganda, Kenya, or Tanzania (stratum A); children with severe hypotension were randomly assigned to one of the bolus groups only (stratum B). All children received appropriate antimicrobial treatment, intravenous maintenance fluids, and supportive care, according to guidelines. Children with malnutrition or gastroenteritis were excluded. The primary end point was 48-hour mortality; secondary end points included pulmonary edema, increased intracranial pressure, and mortality or neurologic sequelae at 4 weeks. RESULTS: The data and safety monitoring committee recommended halting recruitment after 3141 of the projected 3600 children in stratum A were enrolled. Malaria status (57% overall) and clinical severity were similar across groups. The 48-hour mortality was 10.6% (111 of 1050 children), 10.5% (110 of 1047 children), and 7.3% (76 of 1044 children) in the albumin-bolus, saline-bolus, and control groups, respectively (relative risk for saline bolus vs. control, 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09 to 1.90; P=0.01; relative risk for albumin bolus vs. saline bolus, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.29; P=0.96; and relative risk for any bolus vs. control, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.86; P=0.003). The 4-week mortality was 12.2%, 12.0%, and 8.7% in the three groups, respectively (P=0.004 for the comparison of bolus with control). Neurologic sequelae occurred in 2.2%, 1.9%, and 2.0% of the children in the respective groups (P=0.92), and pulmonary edema or increased intracranial pressure occurred in 2.6%, 2.2%, and 1.7% (P=0.17), respectively. In stratum B, 69% of the children (9 of 13) in the albumin-bolus group and 56% (9 of 16) in the saline-bolus group died (P=0.45). The results were consistent across centers and across subgroups according to the severity of shock and status with respect to malaria, coma, sepsis, acidosis, and severe anemia. CONCLUSIONS: Fluid boluses significantly increased 48-hour mortality in critically ill children with impaired perfusion in these resource-limited settings in Africa. (Funded by the Medical Research Council, United Kingdom; FEAST Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN69856593.). <EV> <t> Fluid resuscitation in the management of early septic shock (FINESS): a randomized controlled feasibility trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether fluid resuscitation with colloid or crystalloid in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock is associated with an improvement in clinical outcome. This randomized controlled trial determined the feasibility of conducting a large trial testing resuscitation with pentastarch vs normal saline in early septic shock, powered for a difference in mortality. METHODS: At three Canadian and one New Zealand academic centre, 40 patients with early septic shock defined by at least two systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, infectious source, and persistent hypotension after >or= 1 L of crystalloid fluid were recruited. Feasibility measures were patient recruitment, blinding of the study fluids, and acceptability of the goal directed algorithms. Boluses of blinded normal saline or pentastarch (500 mL - maximum 3 L or 28 mL x kg(-1)) were administered within goal directed care for the first 12 hr. RESULTS: Of 161 patients screened, 121 were excluded and 40 patients were enrolled, for a recruitment rate of 0.75 patients/site/month. Only 57% of physicians and 54% of nurses correctly guessed the study fluid (P = 0.46 and P = 0.67, respectively). The goal directed algorithms were acceptable to 97% of physicians. CONCLUSION: The ability to recruit patients in this pilot randomized controlled trial was below expectations. Blinding of study fluids was adequate, and resuscitation algorithms were acceptable to most physicians. Methods to improve recruitment are required to enhance the feasibility of conducting a multicentre fluid resuscitation trial in early septic shock. <EV> <t> Out-of-hospital hypertonic resuscitation after traumatic hypovolemic shock: a randomized, placebo controlled trial. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To determine whether out-of-hospital administration of hypertonic fluids would improve survival after severe injury with hemorrhagic shock. BACKGROUND: Hypertonic fluids have potential benefit in the resuscitation of severely injured patients because of rapid restoration of tissue perfusion, with a smaller volume, and modulation of the inflammatory response, to reduce subsequent organ injury. METHODS: Multicenter, randomized, blinded clinical trial, May 2006 to August 2008, 114 emergency medical services agencies in North America within the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium. INCLUSION CRITERIA: injured patients, age >/= 15 years with hypovolemic shock (systolic blood pressure </= 70 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure 71-90 mm Hg with heart rate >/= 108 beats per minute). Initial resuscitation fluid, 250 mL of either 7.5% saline per 6% dextran 70 (hypertonic saline/dextran, HSD), 7.5% saline (hypertonic saline, HS), or 0.9% saline (normal saline, NS) administered by out-of-hospital providers. Primary outcome was 28-day survival. On the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board, the study was stopped early (23% of proposed sample size) for futility and potential safety concern. RESULTS: : A total of 853 treated patients were enrolled, among whom 62% were with blunt trauma, 38% with penetrating. There was no difference in 28-day survival-HSD: 74.5% (0.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], -7.5 to 7.8); HS: 73.0% (-1.4; 95% CI, -8.7-6.0); and NS: 74.4%, P = 0.91. There was a higher mortality for the postrandomization subgroup of patients who did not receive blood transfusions in the first 24 hours, who received hypertonic fluids compared to NS [28-day mortality-HSD: 10% (5.2; 95% CI, 0.4-10.1); HS: 12.2% (7.4; 95% CI, 2.5-12.2); and NS: 4.8%, P < 0.01]. CONCLUSION: Among injured patients with hypovolemic shock, initial resuscitation fluid treatment with either HS or HSD compared with NS, did not result in superior 28-day survival. However, interpretation of these findings is limited by the early stopping of the trial. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov, NCT00316017. <EV> <t> Effect of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 on blood loss and coagulation in patients with recent exposure to dual antiplatelet therapy undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery. <abs> BACKGROUND: Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions are often used for maintaining intravascular volume and improving microperfusion, while a large amount of HES can cause adverse effects on coagulation. As the indications for clopidogrel expand, an increasing number of patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB) are also undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), with its higher risk of bleeding complications. The aim of the present study was to determine whether a moderate dose of 6% HES 130/0.4 significantly increases perioperative blood loss in patients with continued DAPT within 5 days of OPCAB. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients who received clopidogrel and aspirin within 5 days of OPCAB were randomly allocated to receive HES 130/0.4 (</= 30 ml/kg) followed by crystalloid infusion (HES group, n=53), or crystalloid only (crystalloid group, n=53) perioperatively. The amount of perioperative blood loss (sum of bleeding during the intraoperative and postoperative 24-h period), transfusion requirements, modified thromboelastography and coagulation variables, hemodynamic parameters, and fluid balance were recorded. Perioperative blood loss and coagulation profiles were similar between the groups, but the postoperative hemoglobin level was higher in the crystalloid group. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 30 ml.kg(-)(1).day(-)(1) of 6% HES 130/0.4 did not increase the perioperative blood loss compared to crystalloid in patients with recent exposure to DAPT undergoing OPCAB. HES 130/0.4 caused a similar degree and duration of coagulation impairment as observed when only crystalloid was given. <EV> <t> Hydroxyethyl starch resuscitation reduces the risk of intra-abdominal hypertension in severe acute pancreatitis. <abs> OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to address whether hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is beneficial for intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) in early stages. METHODS: Forty-one patients with SAP were randomized to HES group (n = 20) and the Ringer's lactate (RL) group (n = 21). The groups received 6% HES 130/0.4 for 8 days and RL solution without colloid, respectively. The primary end point was the IAP. The secondary end points were fluid balance, major organ complications, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Heath Evaluation II score, and the serum levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8. RESULTS: The characteristics of baseline data were similar in the 2 groups. In the HES group, the IAP was significantly lower in 2 to 7 days, and fewer patients received mechanical ventilation (15.0% vs 47.6%). A negative fluid balance was observed earlier in the HES group than in the RL group (2.5 +/- 2.2 vs 4.0 +/- 2.5 days). CONCLUSIONS: Fluid resuscitation with HES in the early stages of SAP can decrease the risk of intra-abdominal hypertension and reduce the use of mechanical ventilation. <EV> <t> Comparison of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 and saline solution for resuscitation of the microcirculation during the early goal-directed therapy of septic patients. <abs> PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to show that 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4 achieves a better resuscitation of the microcirculation than normal saline solution (SS), during early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) in septic patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with severe sepsis were randomized for EGDT with 6% HES 130/0.4 (n = 9) or SS (n = 11). Sublingual microcirculation was evaluated by sidestream dark field imaging 24 hours after the beginning of EGDT. RESULTS: On admission, there were no differences in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, mean arterial pressure, lactate, or central venous oxygen saturation. After 24 hours, no difference arose in those parameters. Sublingual capillary density was similar in both groups (21 +/- 8 versus 20 +/- 3 vessels/mm(2)); but capillary microvascular flow index, percent of perfused capillaries, and perfused capillary density were higher in 6% HES 130/0.4 (2.5 +/- 0.5 versus 1.6 +/- 0.7, 84 +/- 15 versus 53 +/- 26%, and 19 +/- 6 versus 11 +/- 5 vessels/mm(2), respectively, P < .005). CONCLUSIONS: Fluid resuscitation with 6% HES 130/0.4 may have advantages over SS to improve sublingual microcirculation.

Hypotension (decrease in systolic arterial pressure > 20% from baseline), hypertension or bradycardia (heart rate < 50 beats min(-1)) requiring treatment, and the length of stay in the postanaesthesia care unit was recorded. Cognitive functions were evaluated the previous day, and 1 and 7 days after surgery with the Mini Mental State Examination test. RESULTS: Hypotension occurred in seven patients of Group Spinal (46%) and in 12 patients of Group SEVO (80%) (P = 0.05). Phenylephrine was required to control hypotension in three spinal patients (21%) and four SEVO patients (26%) (n.s.). SEVO patients had lower heart rates than spinal patients from 15 to 60 min after anaesthesia induction (P = 0.01). Bradycardia was observed in three SEVO patients (22%). Discharge from the postanaesthesia care unit required 15 (range 5-30) min in Group Spinal and 55 (15-80) min in Group SEVO (P = 0.0005). Eight patients in Group Spinal (53%) and nine patients in Group SEVO (60%) showed cognitive decline (Mini Mental State Examination test decreased > or = 2 points from baseline) 24 h after surgery (n.s.). Seven days after surgery, confusion was still present in one patient of Group Spinal (6%) and in three patients of Group SEVO (20%) (n.s.). CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty of the hip, induction and maintenance with sevoflurane provide a rapid emergence from anaesthesia without more depression of postoperative cognitive function compared with unilateral spinal anaesthesia. This technique represents an attractive option when patient refusal, lack of adequate co-operation or concomitant anticoagulant therapy contraindicate the use of spinal anaesthesia. <EV> <t> [Postoperative delirium after general anesthesia vs. spinal anesthesia in geriatric patients]. <abs> BACKGROUND: Influence of the type of anesthesia on postoperative delirium was examined in geriatric patients with femoral neck fracture. METHODS: Forty patients aged 70 or more were randomly allocated to receive either general anesthesia (sevoflurane, nitrous oxide in oxygen, G group, n = 21) or spinal anesthesia (0.5% bupivacaine, S group, n = 19). G group received the oxygen therapy during the 12-hour postoperative period. Postoperative assessments included the rate of postoperative delirium during the 4-day postoperative period, oxygen saturation during the 18-hour postoperative period, the value of hemoglobin at 1 postoperative day and the number of analgesics requirements during the 4-day postoperative period. RESULTS: The rate of postoperative delirium was similar between the two groups during the 4-day postoperative period. However, that of S group tended to be higher during the 1-day postoperative period. Postoperative analgesic effect and the value of hemoglobin at 1 postoperative day were similar between the two groups.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Laparoscopic versus open appendectomy: a prospective randomized comparison. <abs> BACKGROUND: Whether laparoscopy offers a benefit over open surgery in the management of acute appendicitis or not remains a subject of controversy despite the publication of numerous randomized studies. This study aimed to compare laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) with open appendectomy (OA) and to ascertain its therapeutic benefit. METHODS: Adult patients older than 14 years presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute appendicitis were randomized to undergo either LA or OA from January 2006 to December 2007. Comparisons were based on operating time, time until return to a general diet, time until return to normal activity and work, length of hospital stay, billed charges, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: The study enrolled 220 patients: 108 to undergo OA and 112 to undergo LA. The groups were similar in terms of clinicopathologic characteristics. The operating time seemed to be shorter for the OA patients than for the LA patients, but the difference was not significant (LA, 30 +/- 15.2 min vs. OA, 28.7 +/- 16.3 min; p > 0.05). The hospital stay of 4.1 +/- 1.5 days for the LA group and 7.2 +/- 1.7 days for the OA group, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Laparoscopic appendectomy remained associated with a shorter time until return to a general diet (LA, 20.2 +/- 12.4 h vs. OA, 36.5 +/- 10 h; p < 0.05), to normal activity (LA, 9.1 +/- 4.2 days vs. OA, 13.7 +/- 5.8 days; p < 0.05), and to work (LA, 21.2 +/- 3.5 days vs. OA, 27.7 +/- 4.9 days; p < 0.05). The billed charges appeared to be higher for LA (LA, 5,720.3 +/- 115.7 yuan vs. OA, 5,310 +/- 575.4 yuan), but this difference failed to be clinically important or statistically significant (p > 0.05). Wound infections were more common after OA (n = 14) than after LA (n = 0) (p < 0.05). Intraabdominal abscesses occurred for two patients in the LA group and nine patients in the OA group (p < 0.05). Postoperative ileus occurred with frequencies of 0% in the LA group and 7.4% in the OA group (p < 0.05). The rate for overall complications was significantly lower in the LA group. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic appendectomy is a useful tool in the treatment of acute appendicitis.

METHODS: A total of 65 patients with venous ulcers were randomly divided into three groups: A, B and C. In group A, 22 patients were treated with ultrasound rated at 1 W/cm(2) and with compressive therapy. In group B, 21 patients were treated with ultrasound rated at 0.5 W/cm(2) and with compressive therapy. In both groups the patients were treated with a pulsed wave of a duty cycle of 1/5 (impulse time=2 ms, pause time=8 ms) and frequency of 1 MHz. The 22 patients in group C (control group) were subjected to topical pharmacological treatment. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant reduction of the ulcer area, volume and linear dimensions in all three groups of patients. The ulcer area reduction rate was highest in group B.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Terlipressin or norepinephrine in hyperdynamic septic shock: a prospective, randomized study. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To compare, in patients with hyperdynamic septic shock, the effects of norepinephrine or terlipressin on hemodynamic variables and renal function. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, open-label study. SETTING: Intensive care unit of a university, tertiary, and referral center. PATIENTS: Twenty adult patients with hyperdynamic septic shock, after fluid resuscitation. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive norepinephrine or terlipressin. Global hemodynamic variables, oxygen consumption, urine flow, creatinine clearance, and arterial blood lactate levels were measured. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance, and left and right ventricular stroke work were significantly increased with both drugs. With terlipressin, but not with norepinephrine, a significant decrease in heart rate (from 113 +/- 17 to 104 +/- 11 beats.min(-1), p < .01) and cardiac index (from 5.1 +/- 1.7 to 4.2 +/- 1.6 L.min(-1).m(-2)) was observed, with no change in stroke volume. Oxygen delivery index (from 784 +/- 131 to 701 +/- 92 mL.min(-1).m(-2)) and consumption index (from 244 +/- 69 to 210 +/- 54 mL.min(-1).m(-2)) were significantly decreased with terlipressin, but not with norepinephrine. Blood lactate concentrations were significantly decreased with both drugs. Urine flow and creatinine clearance were increased with both drugs. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with hyperdynamic septic shock, both norepinephrine and terlipressin were effective to raise mean arterial blood pressure. With terlipressin, but not norepinephrine, the improvement in blood pressure was achieved at the expense of cardiac index and oxygen consumption, which were significantly decreased. Renal function was improved with both drugs. In further studies, alternative strategies to maintain cardiac index should be explored, such as a synergy between low-dose terlipressin and dobutamine. <EV> <t> Vasopressin in pediatric vasodilatory shock: a multicenter randomized controlled trial. <abs> RATIONALE: Vasopressin has been proposed as a potent vasoactive agent in the treatment of vasodilatory shock in adults and children. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vasopressin as an adjunctive agent in pediatric vasodilatory shock. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind trial, children with vasodilatory shock were randomized to receive low-dose vasopressin (0.0005-0.002 U/kg/min) or placebo in addition to open-label vasoactive agents. Vasoactive infusions were titrated to clinical endpoints of adequate perfusion. The primary outcome was time to vasoactive-free hemodynamic stability. Secondary outcomes included mortality, organ-failure-free days, length of critical care unit stay, and adverse events. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-five of 69 children (94%) who were randomized received the study drug (33 vasopressin, 32 placebo) and were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome between the vasopressin and placebo groups (49.7 vs. 47.1 hours; P = 0.85). There were 10 deaths (30%) in the vasopressin group and five (15.6%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-5.05; P = 0.24). There were no significant differences with respect to organ failure-free days (22 vs. 25.5 days; P = 0.11), ventilator-free days (16.5 23 days; P = 0.15), length of stay (8 vs. 8.5 days; P = 0.93), or adverse event rate ratios (12.0%; 95% confidence interval, -2.6 to 26.7; P = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose vasopressin did not demonstrate any beneficial effects in this pediatric trial. Although not statistically significant, there was a concerning trend toward increased mortality. Clinical trial registered with www.controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN11597444). <EV> <t> Vasopressin versus norepinephrine infusion in patients with septic shock. <abs> BACKGROUND: Vasopressin is commonly used as an adjunct to catecholamines to support blood pressure in refractory septic shock, but its effect on mortality is unknown. We hypothesized that low-dose vasopressin as compared with norepinephrine would decrease mortality among patients with septic shock who were being treated with conventional (catecholamine) vasopressors. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned patients who had septic shock and were receiving a minimum of 5 microg of norepinephrine per minute to receive either low-dose vasopressin (0.01 to 0.03 U per minute) or norepinephrine (5 to 15 microg per minute) in addition to open-label vasopressors. All vasopressor infusions were titrated and tapered according to protocols to maintain a target blood pressure. The primary end point was the mortality rate 28 days after the start of infusions. RESULTS: A total of 778 patients underwent randomization, were infused with the study drug (396 patients received vasopressin, and 382 norepinephrine), and were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups in the 28-day mortality rate (35.4% and 39.3%, respectively; P=0.26) or in 90-day mortality (43.9% and 49.6%, respectively; P=0.11). There were no significant differences in the overall rates of serious adverse events (10.3% and 10.5%, respectively; P=1.00). In the prospectively defined stratum of less severe septic shock, the mortality rate was lower in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group at 28 days (26.5% vs. 35.7%, P=0.05); in the stratum of more severe septic shock, there was no significant difference in 28-day mortality (44.0% and 42.5%, respectively; P=0.76). A test for heterogeneity between these two study strata was not significant (P=0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose vasopressin did not reduce mortality rates as compared with norepinephrine among patients with septic shock who were treated with catecholamine vasopressors.

The effects of a supplementary arginine vasopressin (AVP) infusion on microcirculation in vasodilatory shock and postoperative multiple organ dysfunction syndrome are unknown. METHOD: Included in the study were 18 patients who had undergone cardiac or major surgery and had a mean arterial blood pressure below 65 mmHg, despite infusion of more than 0.5 microg/kg per min norepinephrine. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a combined infusion of AVP/norepinephrine or norepinephrine alone. Demographic and clinical data were recorded at study entry and after 1 hour. A laser Doppler flowmeter was used to measure the cutaneous microcirculatory response at randomization and after 1 hour. Reactive hyperaemia and oscillatory changes in the Doppler signal were measured during the 3 minutes before and after a 5-minute period of forearm ischaemia. RESULTS: Patients receiving AVP/norepinephrine had a significantly higher mean arterial pressure (P = 0.047) and higher milrinone requirements (P = 0.025) than did the patients who received norepinephrine only at baseline. Mean arterial blood pressure significantly increased (P < 0.001) and norepinephrine requirements significantly decreased (P < 0.001) in the AVP/norepinephrine group. Patients in the AVP/norepinephrine group exhibited a significantly higher oscillation frequency of the Doppler signal before ischaemia and during reperfusion at randomization. During the study period, there were no differences in either cutaneous reactive hyperaemia or the oscillatory pattern of vascular tone between groups. CONCLUSION: Supplementary AVP infusion in patients with advanced vasodilatory shock and severe postoperative multiple organ dysfunction syndrome did not compromise cutaneous reactive hyperaemia and flowmotion when compared with norepinephrine infusion alone. <EV> <t> Norepinephrine plus dobutamine versus epinephrine alone for management of septic shock: a randomised trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: International guidelines for management of septic shock recommend that dopamine or norepinephrine are preferable to epinephrine. However, no large comparative trial has yet been done. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of norepinephrine plus dobutamine (whenever needed) with those of epinephrine alone in septic shock. METHODS: This prospective, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study was done in 330 patients with septic shock admitted to one of 19 participating intensive care units in France. Participants were assigned to receive epinephrine (n=161) or norepinephrine plus dobutamine (n=169), which were titrated to maintain mean blood pressure at 70 mm Hg or more. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00148278. FINDINGS: There were no patients lost to follow-up; one patient withdrew consent after 3 days. At day 28, there were 64 (40%) deaths in the epinephrine group and 58 (34%) deaths in the norepinephrine plus dobutamine group (p=0.31; relative risk 0.86, 95% CI 0.65-1.14). There was no significant difference between the two groups in mortality rates at discharge from intensive care (75 [47%] deaths vs 75 [44%] deaths, p=0.69), at hospital discharge (84 [52%] vs 82 [49%], p=0.51), and by day 90 (84 [52%] vs 85 [50%], p=0.73), time to haemodynamic success (log-rank p=0.67), time to vasopressor withdrawal (log-rank p=0.09), and time course of SOFA score. Rates of serious adverse events were also similar. INTERPRETATION: There is no evidence for a difference in efficacy and safety between epinephrine alone and norepinephrine plus dobutamine for the management of septic shock. <EV> <t> Effects of short-term simultaneous infusion of dobutamine and terlipressin in patients with septic shock: the DOBUPRESS study. <abs> BACKGROUND: Terlipressin bolus infusion may reduce cardiac output and global oxygen supply. The present study was designed to determine whether dobutamine may counterbalance the terlipressin-induced depression in mixed-venous oxygen saturation (Svo) in patients with catecholamine-dependent septic shock. METHODS: Prospective, randomized, controlled study performed in a university hospital intensive care unit. Septic shock patients requiring a continuous infusion of norepinephrine (0.9 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 70 (sd 5) mm Hg were randomly allocated to be treated either with (i) sole norepinephrine infusion (control, n=20), (ii) a single dose of terlipressin 1 mg (n=19), or (iii) a single dose of terlipressin 1 mg followed by dobutamine infusion titrated to reverse the anticipated reduction in Svo2 (n=20). Systemic, pulmonary, and regional haemodynamic variables were obtained at baseline and after 2 and 4 h. Laboratory surrogate markers of organ (dys)function were tested at baseline and after 12 and 24 h. RESULTS: Terlipressin (with and without dobutamine) infusion preserved MAP at 70 (5) mm Hg, while allowing to reduce norepinephrine requirements to 0.17 (0.2) and 0.2 (0.2) microg kg(-1) min(-1), respectively [vs1.4 (0.3) microg kg(-1) min(-1) in controls at 4 h; each P<0.001]. The terlipressin-linked decrease in Svo2 was reversed by dobutamine at a mean dose of 20 (8) microg kg(-1) min(-1) [Svo2 at 4 h: 59 (11)% vs 69 (12)%, P=0.028]. CONCLUSIONS: In human catecholamine-dependent septic shock, terlipressin (with and without concomitant dobutamine infusion) increases MAP and markedly reduces norepinephrine requirements. Although no adverse events were noticed in the present study, potential benefits of increasing Svo2 after terlipressin bolus infusion need to be weighted against the risk of cardiovascular complications resulting from high-dose dobutamine. <EV> <t> Comparison of dopamine and norepinephrine in the treatment of shock. <abs> BACKGROUND: Both dopamine and norepinephrine are recommended as first-line vasopressor agents in the treatment of shock. There is a continuing controversy about whether one agent is superior to the other. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned patients with shock to receive either dopamine or norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor therapy to restore and maintain blood pressure. When blood pressure could not be maintained with a dose of 20 microg per kilogram of body weight per minute for dopamine or a dose of 0.19 microg per kilogram per minute for norepinephrine, open-label norepinephrine, epinephrine, or vasopressin could be added. The primary outcome was the rate of death at 28 days after randomization; secondary end points included the number of days without need for organ support and the occurrence of adverse events. RESULTS: The trial included 1679 patients, of whom 858 were assigned to dopamine and 821 to norepinephrine. The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of death at 28 days (52.5% in the dopamine group and 48.5% in the norepinephrine group; odds ratio with dopamine, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.42; P=0.10). However, there were more arrhythmic events among the patients treated with dopamine than among those treated with norepinephrine (207 events [24.1%] vs. 102 events [12.4%], P<0.001). A subgroup analysis showed that dopamine, as compared with norepinephrine, was associated with an increased rate of death at 28 days among the 280 patients with cardiogenic shock but not among the 1044 patients with septic shock or the 263 with hypovolemic shock (P=0.03 for cardiogenic shock, P=0.19 for septic shock, and P=0.84 for hypovolemic shock, in Kaplan-Meier analyses). CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no significant difference in the rate of death between patients with shock who were treated with dopamine as the first-line vasopressor agent and those who were treated with norepinephrine, the use of dopamine was associated with a greater number of adverse events.

Two hundred and eighty patients were randomised to receive either epinephrine or norepinephrine. Median time to achieve the MAP goal was 35.1 h (interquartile range (IQR) 13.8-70.4 h) with epinephrine compared to 40.0 h (IQR 14.5-120 h) with norepinephrine (relative risk (RR) 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-1.12; P = 0.26). There was no difference in the time to achieve MAP goals in the subgroups of patients with severe sepsis (n = 158; RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.59-1.12; P = 0.18) or those with acute circulatory failure (n = 192; RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.62-1.27; P = 0.49) between epinephrine and norepinephrine. Epinephrine was associated with the development of significant but transient metabolic effects that prompted the withdrawal of 18/139 (12.9%) patients from the study by attending clinicians. There was no difference in 28 and 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the development of potential drug-related effects with epinephrine, there was no difference in the achievement of a MAP goal between epinephrine and norepinephrine in a heterogenous population of ICU patients. <EV> <t> Efficacy and safety of dopamine versus norepinephrine in the management of septic shock. <abs> The optimum septic shock vasopressor support strategy is currently debated. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) as the initial vasopressor in septic shock patients who were managed with a specific treatment protocol. A prospective, randomized, open-label, clinical trial was used in a medical intensive care unit comparing DA with NE as the initial vasopressor in fluid-resuscitated 252 adult patients with septic shock. If the maximum dose of the initial vasopressor was unable to maintain the hemodynamic goal, then fixed-dose vasopressin was added to each regimen. If additional vasopressor support was needed to achieve the hemodynamic goal, then phenylephrine was added. The primary efficacy end point was all-cause 28-day mortality. Secondary end points included organ dysfunction, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, and safety (primarily occurrence of arrhythmias). The 28-day mortality rate was 50% (67/134) with DA as the initial vasopressor compared with 43% (51/118) for NE treatment (P = 0.282). There was a significantly greater incidence of sinus tachycardia with DA (24.6%; 33/134) than NE (5.9%; 7/118) and arrhythmias noted with DA treatment (19.4%; 26/134) compared with NE treatment (3.4%; 4/118; P < 0.0001), respectively. Logistic regression analysis identified Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (P < 0.0001) and arrhythmia (P < 0.015) as significant predictors of outcome. In this protocol-directed vasopressor support strategy for septic shock, DA and NE were equally effective as initial agents as judged by 28-day mortality rates. However, there were significantly more cardiac arrhythmias with DA treatment. Patients receiving DA should be monitored for the development of cardiac arrhythmias (NCT00604019). <EV> <t> Vasopressin or norepinephrine in early hyperdynamic septic shock: a randomized clinical trial. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and norepinephrine (NE) on hemodynamic variables, organ dysfunction, and adverse events in early hyperdynamic septic shock. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized, controlled, open-label trial. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three patients with early (12h) hyperdynamic septic shock in two teaching hospitals. INTERVENTIONS: AVP (0.04-0.20 Umin(-1), n=13) as a single agent or NE (0.1-2.8microg kg(-1)min(-1), n=10) infusion for 48[Symbol: see text]h to achieve mean arterial pressure at or above 70mmHg. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hemodynamic parameters and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were measured. AVP and NE equally increased mean arterial pressure over 48h, but NE was required in 36% of AVP patients at 48h. Compared to baseline, AVP increased systemic vascular resistance, decreased exposure to NE, decreased cardiac output by decreasing heart rate, increased creatinine clearance, and improved SOFA score. The PrCO(2) - PaCO(2) difference remained stable throughout the study. One AVP patient developed acute coronary syndrome with dose-dependent ECG changes. Three patients in both groups died during their ICU stay. CONCLUSION: In early hyperdynamic septic shock, the administration of high-dose AVP as a single agent fails to increase mean arterial pressure in the first hour but maintains it above 70mmHg in two-thirds of patients at 48h. AVP decreases NE exposure, has no effect on the PrCO(2) - PaCO(2 )difference, and improves renal function and SOFA score. <EV> <t> Terlipressin as a rescue therapy for catecholamine-resistant septic shock in children. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of terlipressin on oxygenation, PaO2/FIO2, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and mortality in children with septic shock refractory to high doses of dopamine/dobutamine and adrenaline. DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized, nonblind study in the pediatric intensive care unit of a university hospital. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: We studied 58 children with septic shock and refractory hypotension despite fluid loading and high doses of catecholamines, randomly enrolled to terlipressin (TP, n=30) or control (n=28). TP was administered as intravenous bolus doses of 20 microg/kg every 6 h for a maximum of 96 h. Hemodynamic changes, PaO2/FIO2 rates, length of stay, and mortality rate in PICU were recorded prospectively. RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure and PaO2/FIO2 significantly increased, and heart rate significantly decreased 30 min after each TP treatment, but mortality did not differ from control (67.3% vs. 71.4%). Mean stay in the PICU was shorter in the TP group (13.4+/-7.9 vs. 20.2+/-9.7 days and was longer among nonsurvivors of the TP group vs. control (10.4+/-6.9 vs. 6.2+/-3.4 days). Blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, AST, ALT, and urine output of patients in the TP group did not change after terlipressin. CONCLUSIONS: Although terlipressin infusion had no effect on mortality, it significantly increases mean arterial pressure, PaO2/FIO2, and survival time in nonsurvivors. Terlipressin seems to cause no adverse effect but warrants further evaluation as a rescue therapy in refractory septic shock. <EV> <t> Continuous terlipressin versus vasopressin infusion in septic shock (TERLIVAP): a randomized, controlled pilot study. <abs> INTRODUCTION: Recent clinical data suggest that early administration of vasopressin analogues may be advantageous compared to a last resort therapy. However, it is still unknown whether vasopressin and terlipressin are equally effective for hemodynamic support in septic shock. The aim of the present prospective, randomized, controlled pilot trial study was, therefore, to compare the impact of continuous infusions of either vasopressin or terlipressin, when given as first-line therapy in septic shock patients, on open-label norepinephrine requirements. METHODS: We enrolled septic shock patients (n = 45) with a mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg despite adequate volume resuscitation. Patients were randomized to receive continuous infusions of either terlipressin (1.3 microg.kg-1.h-1), vasopressin (.03 U.min-1) or norepinephrine (15 microg.min-1; n = 15 per group). In all groups, open-label norepinephrine was added to achieve a mean arterial pressure between 65 and 75 mmHg, if necessary. Data from right heart and thermo-dye dilution catheterization, gastric tonometry, as well as laboratory variables of organ function were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours after randomization. Differences within and between groups were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA for repeated measurements with group and time as factors. Time-independent variables were compared with one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: There were no differences among groups in terms of systemic and regional hemodynamics. Compared with infusion of .03 U of vasopressin or 15 microg.min-1 of norepinephrine, 1.3 microg.kg-1.h-1 of terlipressin allowed a marked reduction in catecholamine requirements (0.8 +/- 1.3 and 1.2 +/- 1.4 vs. 0.2 +/- 0.4 microg.kg-1.min-1 at 48 hours; each P < 0.05) and was associated with less rebound hypotension (P < 0.05). At the end of the 48-hour intervention period, bilirubin concentrations were higher in the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups as compared with the terlipressin group (2.3 +/- 2.8 and 2.8 +/- 2.5 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.3 mg.dL-1; each P < 0.05). A time-dependent decrease in platelet count was only observed in the terlipressin group (P < 0.001 48 hours vs. BL). CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides evidence that continuous infusion of low-dose terlipressin--when given as first-line vasopressor agent in septic shock--is effective in reversing sepsis-induced arterial hypotension and in reducing norepinephrine requirements.", "summary:reference": "There is some evidence of no difference in mortality between norepinephrine and dopamine.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Ketorolac is not nephrotoxic in connection with sevoflurane anesthesia in patients undergoing breast surgery. <abs> UNLABELLED: Ketorolac, which may cause renal vasoconstriction by cyclooxygenase inhibition, is often administered to patients anesthetized with sevoflurane that is metabolized to inorganic fluoride (F(-)), another potential nephrotoxin. We assessed this possible interaction using urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase indexed to urinary creatinine (U-NAG/crea) as a marker of proximal tubular, beta2-microglobulin as a tubular, urine oxygen tension (P(u)O(2)) as a medullary, and erythropoietin as a marker of tubulointerstitial damage. Thirty women (ASA physical status I-II) undergoing breast surgery were included in our double-blinded study. They were allocated into two groups receiving either ketorolac 30 mg IM (Group K) or saline (Group C) at the time of premedication, at the end of, and 6 h after anesthesia maintained with sevoflurane. Urine output, U-NAG/crea, P(u)O(2,) serum creatinine, urea, and F(-) were assessed. Blood loss was larger in Group K (465 +/- 286 mL vs 240 +/- 149 mL, mean +/- SD, P < 0.05). The MAC-doses of sevoflurane were similar. U-NAG/crea increased during the first 2 h of anesthesia and serum F(-) peaked 2 h after the anesthesia without differences between the groups. There were no statistically significant changes in P(u)O(2), erythropoietin, beta2-microglobulin, serum creatinine, urea, or urine output during anesthesia or the recovery period in either group. Our results indicate that the kidneys are not affected by ketorolac administered in connection with sevoflurane anesthesia. IMPLICATIONS: The different kinetics of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase indexed to urinary creatinine and serum inorganic fluoride during and after sevoflurane anesthesia suggest that the observed mild renal tubular function deterioration is not caused by inorganic fluoride. Administration of ketorolac IM is therefore considered safe in adequately hydrated healthy adult patients given sevoflurane anesthesia. <EV> <t> Tenoxicam i.v. for major gynaecological surgery--effects on renal function. <abs> Thirty women presenting for major gynaecological oncology surgery under a standardized, combined epidural/general anaesthetic technique received either placebo or tenoxicam 20 mg intravenously, in a randomized double-blinded manner prior to surgery. Plasma and urinary electrolytes, creatinine, prostaglandins PgE2 and PgF1 alpha, and thromboxane (TxB2) were collected 12 hours preoperatively and then for four days postoperatively. There were no significant differences in any of the measured parameters between the groups, at any of the measurement times. Mean (SD) creatinine clearance at baseline, 24 h and 48 h was 100.4 (29.7) and 86.9 (27.5), 128.1 (45.9) and 115.0 (40.3), 137.5 (50.7) and 121.6 (38.6) in the placebo and tenoxicam groups respectively (P = 0.28). Both groups required similar amounts of intraoperative ephedrine and intravenous fluids to maintain blood pressure. The minimal changes in plasma and renal parameters reflect predictable responses to major surgery and rehydration rather than any response to cyclooxygenase inhibition. This may underscore the importance of maintenance of blood pressure during the course of surgery and postoperative care, and perhaps the usefulness of a fluid loading regimen to preserve renal function during surgery. The predicted attenuation of renal prostaglandin-mediated protective mechanisms and enhancement of the catecholamine-mediated renal vasoconstriction by the use of a single 20 mg dose of tenoxicam in this study were not seen. Modulation of renal concentrating mechanisms or excretion of sodium and potassium by tenoxicam was not apparent and a large increase in study size would be required to detect a significant difference in these parameters as a consequence of the drug, over and above any changes in response to surgery and epidural anaesthesia. <EV> <t> Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in treatment of postoperative pain after cardiac surgery. <abs> PURPOSE: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used as analgesic in postoperative pain to reduce opioid side effects, such as drowsiness and nausea. However, NSAIDs have not been used extensively in cardiac surgical patients due to the fear of untoward effects on gastric, renal, and coagulation parameters. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of three NSAIDs for pain control in CABG patients. METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients scheduled for elective CABG surgery were enrolled in randomized, double blind, controlled study. Standardized fast track cardiac anesthesia was used. One dose of drug (75 mg diclofenac, 100 mg ketoprofen, 100 mg indomethacin, or placebo) was given pr one hour before tracheal extubation and a second dose 12 hr later. Pain was treated with morphine iv and acetaminophen po. Visual analogue pain scores were recorded at baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hr after the first dose of drug. RESULTS: There were no differences among the groups in pain scores. Only patients who received diclofenac required less morphine than patients in the control group (P < 0.05). When the total amounts of pain medications were computed to morphine equivalents, only patients in the diclofenac group received less pain medications than the placebo group (P < 0.05). Proportion of patients with postoperative increase of creatinine level (20% and over) did not differ between placebo and drug groups. CONCLUSION: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be used for analgesia management post CABG surgery in selected patients. Diclofenac appears to have the best analgesic effects by reducing the morphine and other analgesic requirement postoperatively. <EV> <t> Morphine-sparing effect of ketoprofen after abdominal surgery. <abs> In a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (power of 80% to detect a 30% reduction in morphine consumption, P < 0.05), we have determined that the administration of two doses of intravenous ketoprofen 100 mg, one at the end of surgery and the second 12 hours postoperatively, was associated with a significant reduction in morphine consumption at eight (P = 0.028), 12 (P = 0.013) and 24 hours (P = 0.013) but not four hours (P = 0.065) postoperatively, as compared to placebo, when assessed by patient-controlled analgesia. There was no difference between the groups in pain scores or in the incidence of nausea and vomiting. One patient in the placebo group suffered from excessive sedation while one patient from the ketoprofen group suffered from transient oliguric renal failure. There were no other adverse effects. The results of this study show that ketoprofen does provide a morphine-sparing effect in the management of postoperative pain after abdominal surgery. <EV> <t> Prospective double-blind study of effect of ketorolac administration after laparoscopic urologic surgery. <abs> BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To decrease postoperative dependence on narcotics for analgesia, we have evaluated ketorolac as an adjunct to perioperative pain control in patients undergoing laparoscopic urologic surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-five patients (34 male, 31 female) were randomized to receive either ketorolac tromethamine (15-30 mg IV q 6 h) or placebo prior to laparoscopic surgery. Patient-controlled analgesia in the form of morphine sulfate was provided. Operative factors such as the type of surgery, operative time, and estimated blood loss were recorded. Postoperative factors such as analog pain score (range 0-10), narcotic usage, and length of stay were evaluated. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients completed the study. The average pain score was 2.2 and 4.5 for the ketorolac and placebo groups, respectively (P < 0.005). The mean amounts of total morphine used were 39.2 mg (ketorolac) and 62.5 mg (placebo) (P = 0.077). The length of stay was not significantly different in the ketorolac (2.5 days) and placebo (2.6 days) groups (P = 0.74). Operative times (P = 0.21) and estimated blood loss (P = 0.60) were not significantly different in the two groups. Ketorolac did not adversely affect renal function; serum creatinine changes were not significantly different from those in the patients receiving placebo (P = 0.50). Laparoscopic pyeloplasty necessitated more narcotic analgesia than did other laparoscopic procedures (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Ketorolac decreases the subjective perception of pain after laparoscopic urologic surgery. It is suggested that ketorolac administration decreases the amount of narcotic usage as well. Time to resumption of oral intake and length of hospital stay were not influenced by use of ketorolac.", "summary:reference": "NSAIDs caused a clinically unimportant transient reduction in renal function in the early post-operative period in patients with normal pre-operative renal function.

Reduction in the area above 37.0 degrees C versus time curve was significantly greater for IV-ibuprofen than for placebo during the first 72 hours after first administration. No patients developed severe malaria; parasite clearance was delayed in the patients whose fevers were controlled by IV-ibuprofen (median 37.3 hours versus 23.7 hours in the placebo group [P = 0.0024]). This difference did not appear to be clinically important Adverse events, none considered severe, occurred equally in both groups. IV-ibuprofen was effective and well tolerated in reducing fever in febrile inpatients with malaria. <EV> <t> Antipyretic effect of ibuprofen in Gabonese children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Antipyretic drugs are widely used in children with fever, though there is a controversy about the benefit of reducing fever in children with malaria. In order to assess the effect of ibuprofen on fever compared to placebo in children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Gabon, a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial, was designed. METHODS: Fifty children between two and seven years of age with uncomplicated malaria were included in the study. For the treatment of fever, all patients \"received\" mechanical treatment when the temperature rose above 37.5 degrees C. In addition to the mechanical treatment, continuous fanning and cooling blanket, patients were assigned randomly to receive ibuprofen (7 mg/kg body weight, every eight hours) or placebo. RESULTS: The fever clearance time using a fever threshold of 37.5 degrees C was similar in children receiving ibuprofen compared to those receiving placebo. The difference was also not statistically significant using a fever threshold of 37.8 degrees C or 38.0 degrees C. However, the fever time and the area under the fever curve were significantly smaller in the ibuprofen group compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Ibuprofen is effective in reducing the time with fever. The effect on fever clearance is less obvious and depends on definition of the fever threshold. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial registration number is: NCT00167713. <EV> <t> Paracetamol versus placebo in treatment of non-severe malaria in children in Guinea-Bissau: a randomized controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: The current guidelines for treatment of malaria include paracetamol to children with fever. No convincing evidence for the beneficial effects of this practice exists. Studies show that time to parasite clearance is significantly longer in children treated with paracetamol, which questions the policy. Whether this is of clinical importance has not been investigated. METHODS: Children with Plasmodium falciparum monoinfection and >/=20 parasites per 200 leucocytes at the Bandim Health Centre, Guinea-Bissau were randomized to receive paracetamol or placebo together with chloroquine for three days in a double blind randomized study. Temperature and symptoms were recorded twice daily during treatment and on day 3. The participants were interviewed and a malaria film taken once weekly until day 35. The data is in the form of grouped failure-times, the outcome of interest being time until parasitaemia during follow-up. Mantel-Haenszel weighted odds ratios are given. Other differences between and within the two groups have been tested using the Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: In the evening of the day of inclusion, the temperature was slightly, but statistically insignificant, higher in the placebo group and significantly more children complained of headache. At no other time was a significant difference in temperature or symptoms detected. However, 6 children from the placebo-group as compared to two children from the paracetamol-group were admitted to hospital with high fever and convulsions by day 3. No differences in the cumulative percentages of children with adequate clinical and parasitological response were found in the intention-to-treat analysis or in the per-protocol analysis. CONCLUSION: Fewer children had early treatment failure and the mean temperature was slightly lower in the afternoon on day 0 in the paracetamol group. However, the cumulative adequate clinical and parasitological cure rates were not significantly different during the period of study. It is doubtful whether adding paracetamol to the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in children is beneficial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00137566. <EV> <t> Antipyretic, parasitologic, and immunologic effects of combining sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine with chloroquine or paracetamol for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. <abs> Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) is increasingly used against malaria in sub-Saharan Africa because of chloroquine resistance. However, chloroquine may have a beneficial antipyretic effect. We therefore compared the combination of SP plus chloroquine, chloroquine alone, SP alone, and SP plus paracetamol in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in 175 Tanzanian children (1-4 years old) in a randomized trial. Outcome variables were axillary temperatures every six hours, daily parasitemias, and serum levels of IgG antibodies to P. falciparum. Lower mean temperatures (6-48 hours) were achieved with SP plus chloroquine or paracetamol than with SP alone (P < 0.001) or chloroquine alone (P < 0.05). All three SP-treated groups showed high and similar parasite reduction (0-48 hours), whereas treatment with chloroquine alone was much less effective. Levels of IgG antibodies to P. falciparum increased significantly (P < 0.001) and similarly in the four treatment groups between days 0, 2, and 3. Thus, the addition of chloroquine or paracetamol to SP improved the clinical outcome, but did not affect the parasitologic response or antibody production.", "summary:reference": "We do not know whether antipyretics alter parasite clearance time.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Lactobacillus paracasei strain ST11 has no effect on rotavirus but ameliorates the outcome of nonrotavirus diarrhea in children from Bangladesh. <abs> BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that selected strains of lactobacilli that are administered orally result in a modest reduction of diarrhea duration. However, duration alone is not considered optimal for therapeutic evaluation of any agent in diarrhea. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of a new probiotic, Lactobacillus paracasei strain ST11 (ST11), in acute childhood diarrhea by using evaluation criteria recommended by the World Health Organization. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 230 male infants and young children, 4 to 24 months of age, presenting with diarrhea of <2 days' duration were admitted to the metabolic research ward of the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh, and fed 10(10) colony-forming units of lyophilized ST11 or placebo daily for 5 days. Stool output and frequency, oral rehydration solution intake, and excretion of rotavirus were monitored daily. RESULTS: No effect of ST11 treatment on severe rotavirus diarrhea was observed. However, the probiotic treatment did significantly reduce cumulative stool output (225 +/- 218 vs 381 +/- 240 mL/kg), stool frequency (27.9 +/- 17 vs 42.5 +/- 26), and oral rehydration solution intake (180 +/- 207 vs 331 +/- 236 mL/kg) in children with less-severe nonrotavirus diarrhea compared with those receiving placebo treatment. A significantly higher proportion of nonrotavirus children receiving ST11 had their diarrhea resolve within 6 days of therapy (ST11 versus placebo: 76% vs 49%). CONCLUSIONS: ST11 has a clinically significant benefit in the management of children with nonrotavirus-induced diarrhea, but it is ineffective in those with rotavirus diarrhea. <EV> <t> Role of a probiotic (Saccharomyces boulardii) in management and prevention of diarrhoea. <abs> AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii) in acute watery diarrhoea and its role in reducing the frequency of episodes of diarrhoea in subsequent two months. METHODS: Children from 2 mo to 12 years of age, with acute diarrhoea were selected according to inclusion criteria and randomised in S. boulardii group (treated with ORS, nutritional support and S. boulardii, 250 mg bid) and in control group (treated with ORS and nutritional support only). Active treatment phase was 5 d and each child was followed for two months afterwards. Frequency and consistency of stools as well as safety of drug was assessed on every visit. A comparison of two groups was done in terms of number of diarrhoeal episode in subsequent two months. RESULTS: There were fifty patients in each group. Baseline characteristics such as mean age and the average frequency of stools were comparable in S. boulardii and control group at the time of inclusion in the trial. By d 3 it reduced to 2.7 and 4.2 stools per d respectively and by d 6 it reduced to 1.6 (S. boulardii Group) and 3.3 (control group). The duration of diarrhoea was 3.6 d in S. boulardii group whereas it was 4.8 d in control group (P = 0.001). In the following two months, S. boulardii group had a significantly lower frequency of 0.54 episodes as compared to 1.08 episodes in control group. The drug was well accepted and tolerated. There were no reports of the side effects during treatment period. CONCLUSION: S. boulardii significantly reduces the frequency and duration of acute diarrhoea. The consistency of stool also improves. The drug is well-tolerated. <EV> <t> Effect of a lactose-free milk formula supplemented with bifidobacteria and streptococci on the recovery from acute diarrhoea. <abs> Probiotics have been proposed for the management and prevention of acute diarrhoea in infants. A double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled study was carried out in 224 Chinese infants 6 to 36 months of age with severe acute diarrhoea and free from moderate or severe malnutrition. After oral or parenteral rehydration, they were allocated to one of three groups: a lactose-free formula (Control); the same formula but with viable 10(8)CFU B. lactis Bb12 and 5x10(7)CFU St. thermophilus TH4 per gram of powder and, the same formula with the same microorganisms, but with 10(9)CFU/g and 5x10(8)CFU, respectively. Anthropometric parameters, duration of the diarrhoea and rotavirus shedding were evaluated. Eighty seven percent of the episodes were associated with rotavirus infection. The duration of the diarrhoea was not influenced by the intake of probiotics. However, a decrease of rotavirus shedding was observed in infants fed the formula with 10(9) Bb12/g, a finding of probable epidemiological importance in the transmission of this agent. <EV> <t> A randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of lactobacillus GG in infantile diarrhea. <abs> In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 229 infants hospitalized for acute diarrhea in rural India were given a 10-day course of Lactobacillus rhammosus GG (minimum dose, 10 degrees bacteria) or placebo. There was no difference in groups in the duration of diarrhea or numbers of stool on days 3, 6, or 10 of treatment. <EV> <t> Probiotics for treatment of acute diarrhoea in children: randomised clinical trial of five different preparations. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of five probiotic preparations recommended to parents in the treatment of acute diarrhoea in children. Design Randomised controlled clinical trial in collaboration with family paediatricians over 12 months. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 3-36 months visiting a family paediatrician for acute diarrhoea. INTERVENTION: Children's parents were randomly assigned to receive written instructions to purchase a specific probiotic product: oral rehydration solution (control group); Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG; Saccharomyces boulardii; Bacillus clausii; mix of L delbrueckii var bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, L acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum; or Enterococcus faecium SF68. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were duration of diarrhoea and daily number and consistency of stools. Secondary outcomes were duration of vomiting and fever and rate of admission to hospital. Safety and tolerance were also recorded. RESULTS: 571 children were allocated to intervention. Median duration of diarrhoea was significantly shorter (P<0.001) in children who received L rhamnosus strain GG (78.5 hours) and the mix of four bacterial strains (70.0 hours) than in children who received oral rehydration solution alone (115.0 hours). One day after the first probiotic administration, the daily number of stools was significantly lower (P<0.001) in children who received L rhamnosus strain GG and in those who received the probiotic mix than in the other groups. The remaining preparations did not affect primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Not all commercially available probiotic preparations are effective in children with acute diarrhoea. Paediatricians should choose bacterial preparations based on effectiveness data. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN56067537 [controlled-trials.com]. <EV> <t> Efficacy of Lactobacillus GG in aboriginal children with acute diarrhoeal disease: a randomised clinical trial. <abs> OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of probiotic therapy for acute rotavirus infectious diarrhoea in an indigenous setting with bacterial/parasitic diarrhoea is unclear. In the present study, we assessed the efficacy of probiotics in Australian Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory admitted to hospital with diarrhoeal disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted in Aboriginal children (ages 4 months-2 years), admitted to hospital with acute diarrhoeal disease (>3 loose stools per day). Children received either oral Lactobacillus GG (5 x 10(9) colony-forming units 3 times per day for 3 days; n = 33) or placebo (n = 31). Small intestinal functional capacity was assessed by the noninvasive 13C-sucrose breath test on days 1 and 4. RESULTS: Both groups showed mean improvement in the sucrose breath test after 4 days; however, there was no difference (mean, 95% confidence interval) between probiotic (2.9 [cumulative percentage of dose recovered at 90 minutes]; 1.7-4.2) and placebo (3.7; 2.3-5.2) groups. Probiotics did not change the duration of diarrhoea, total diarrhoea stools, or diarrhoea score compared with placebo. There was a significant (P < 0.05) difference in diarrhoea frequency on day 2 between probiotics (3.3 [loose stools]; 2.5-4.3) and placebo (4.7; 3.8-5.7) groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus GG did not appear to enhance short-term recovery following acute diarrhoeal illness in this setting. <EV> <t> Use of VSL[sharp]3 in the treatment of rotavirus diarrhea in children: preliminary results. <abs> UNLABELLED: We conducted a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of VSL[sharp]3 (CD Pharma India) in the treatment of acute rotavirus diarrhea in children. The patients were randomly assigned to receive 4 days of oral treatment with VSL[sharp]3 probiotic mixture or placebo in addition to usual care for diarrhea. RESULTS: Out of 230 rotavirus-positive acute diarrhea children, 224 children completed the study, (113 in the drug group and 111 in the placebo group). At recruitment on Day 1, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of frequency of vomiting, mean loose stool frequency, stool consistency, and mean frequency of oral rehydration salts (ORS) and intravenous fluids administered. On Day 2, a lower mean stool frequency and improved stool consistency was noted in the drug group, which achieved statistical significance. This was also reflected in the lower volume of ORS administration in the drug group. Even on Day 3, mean loose stool frequency and frequency of ORS use and frequency of intravenous fluid use was significantly lower in the drug group. The differences in the frequency of loose stools persisted till 8 hours of Day 4. After this, as the placebo group also showed spontaneous improvement the difference between the 2 groups in terms of the overall stools frequency became comparable. However, the overall ORS requirement continued to be significantly lower in the drug group even on Day 4. The overall recovery rates were significantly better in the drug group compared with placebo. No side effects were noted with the use of the probiotic mixture. Use of probiotic mixture VSL[sharp]3 in acute rotavirus diarrhea resulted in earlier recovery and reduced frequency of ORS administration reflecting decreased stool volume losses during diarrhea. <EV> <t> Effect of Saccharomyces boulardii in children with acute gastroenteritis and its relationship to the immune response. <abs> We evaluated the effect of Saccharomyces boulardii administration in otherwise healthy children aged between 6 months and 10 years who were admitted for acute diarrhoea (15 males, 12 females). The patients were randomized into two groups: group 1 (n = 16) received 250 mg S. boulardii dissolved in 5 ml of water orally twice daily for 7 days and group 2 (n = 11) received placebo. Clinical and laboratory assessments were performed on admission and on day 7 of follow-up. Both groups experienced reduced daily stool frequency, the decrease being significantly greater in group 1 on days 3 and 4 compared with group 2. Group 1 demonstrated significant increases in serum immunoglobulin A and decreases in C-reactive protein levels on day 7. The percentage of CD8 lymphocytes on day 7 was significantly higher in group 1 than group 2. This study confirmed the efficacy of S. boulardii in paediatric acute gastroenteritis and the findings suggest that S. boulardii treatment enhances the immune response. <EV> <t> Nitazoxanide vs. probiotics for the treatment of acute rotavirus diarrhea in children: a randomized, single-blind, controlled trial in Bolivian children. <abs> BACKGROUND: In previous studies, nitazoxanide has demonstrated a cytoprotective effect against rotavirus, reducing the duration of diarrhea in comparison to placebo. We designed a randomized, single-blind, controlled trial in order to assess the effectiveness of nitazoxanide and probiotics in comparison with a control group. METHODS: Seventy-five children aged from 28 days to 24 months, with rotavirus diarrhea, were randomly assigned to receive either oral nitazoxanide (15 mg/kg/day) twice a day for three days, a combination of oral probiotics, 1 g twice a day for five days, or only oral or systemic rehydration solutions. The duration of diarrhea and of hospitalization were the primary outcome measures, and daily stool frequency, vomiting, and fever were some of the secondary outcome measures analyzed. RESULTS: The median duration of hospitalization was significantly shorter (p = 0.017) in patients who received nitazoxanide (81 h) and probiotics (72 h) compared to patients who received oral rehydration solution alone (108 h). Similarly, the median duration of diarrhea was significantly reduced (p = 0.009) in children who received nitazoxanide (54 h) and probiotics (48 h) compared to the control group (79 h). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with nitazoxanide and probiotics is effective in the management of children with acute rotavirus diarrhea. Small differences in favor of nitazoxanide were found in comparison with probiotics. Nitazoxanide is an important treatment option for rotavirus diarrhea. <EV> <t> Efficacy of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in acute watery diarrhoea of Indian children: a randomised controlled trial. <abs> AIM: To evaluate the role of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) as probiotic in acute watery diarrhoea (AWD). SETTING: Hospital-based study. DESIGN: Randomised, controlled, blinded trial. PATIENTS AND METHOD: All patients of AWD (n = 684) admitted over 1-year period were invited to participate in the study as per predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria and were randomised to intervention and control groups. After adequate rehydration the intervention group (n = 330) received ORS with probiotic powder containing 60 million cells of LGG, while the control group (n = 332) received ORS alone twice daily for a minimum period of 7 days or till diarrhoea ceased. During the study period all patients received ORS and/or IV fluids for ongoing losses, and nutritional supplementation. None of them received any antibiotic or antidiarrhoeal medication. After exclusion of 16 patients, 646 (323 in each arm) patients completed the study. The daily frequency and total duration of diarrhoea and vomiting and the length of hospital stay were studied. Data were analysed by SPSS-10 software. Statistical significance was calculated by Student's t-test and chi2-test. RESULTS: Rotavirus was isolated in 75.85%. There was no significant difference between treatment groups in the daily frequency or duration of diarrhoea or vomiting or in the length of hospital stay. No complication was observed from the use of LGG. CONCLUSION: LGG supplementation does not decrease the frequency and duration of diarrhoea and vomiting in children with AWD, and does not reduce hospital stay in these patients. <EV> <t> The probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) stops acute diarrhoea in infants and toddlers. <abs> In most cases, acute diarrhoea will become self-limiting during the first few days after onset. For young children, however, health risks may develop when the disease lasts longer than 3 days. The purpose of the present trial was to determine whether the stool frequency of infants and toddlers suffering from acute diarrhoea could be normalised more quickly by administering the probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) solution than by administering a placebo. The safety of EcN were also assessed. A total of 113 children (aged 2-47 months) with acute diarrhoea (> three watery or loose stools in 24 h) were randomised to either a group receiving the probiotic EcN suspension (n = 55) or a group receiving the placebo suspension (n = 58) in a confirmative, double-blind clinical trial. Depending on the age of patients, 1-3 ml per day of verum suspension (10(8) viable EcN cells per millilitre) or placebo were administered orally. The causes of the diarrhoea were viral rather than bacterial, but they were mainly unspecific infections. The median onset of treatment response (reduction of daily stool frequency to </= three watery or loose stools over at least 2 consecutive days) occurred more rapidly in the children receiving the EcN solution (2.5 days) than in those receiving the placebo (4.8 days), a significant difference (2.3 days; p = 0.0007). The number of patients showing a response was clearly higher (p < 0.0001) in the EcN group (52/55; 94.5%) than in the placebo group (39/58; 67.2%). EcN was found to be safe and well-tolerated, and it showed a significant superiority compared to the placebo in the treatment of acute diarrhoea in infants and toddlers. <EV> <t> Effect of Saccharomyces boulardii in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea in Myanmar children: a randomized controlled study. <abs> This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Saccharomyces boulardii in acute diarrhea. One hundred hospitalized children in Myanmar (age range = 3 months to 10 years) were included. Fifty were treated with S. boulardii for five days in addition to oral rehydration solution (ORS) and 50 were given ORS alone (control group) in an alternating order. The mean duration of diarrhea was 3.08 days in the S. boulardii group and 4.68 days (P < 0.05) in the control group. Stools had a normal consistency on day 3 in 38 (76%) of 50 patients in the S. boulardii group compared with only 12 (24%) of 50 in the control group (P = 0.019). On day 2, 27 (54%) of 50 had less than three stools per day in the S. boulardii group compared with only 15 (30%) of 50 in the control group (P = 0.019). Saccharomyces boulardii shortens the duration of diarrhea and normalizes stool consistency and frequency. The shortening of the duration of diarrhea results in a social and economic benefits. <EV> <t> Saccharomyces boulardii in acute childhood diarrhoea: a randomized, placebo-controlled study. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii) as an adjuvant to oral rehydration solution (ORS) in shortening the duration of acute infectious gastroenteritis in children less than 2 years old in ambulatory care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a period of 1 year, 100 outpatients between 3 and 24 months old presenting with acute mild to moderate diarrhoea of less than 7 days duration, were included in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of S. boulardii administered for 6 days. Twelve children were lost in follow-up; the data of 88 children could be analysed (44 in the placebo and 44 in the S. boulardii group). Seventy-two patients were followed for one month (37 in the placebo and 35 in the S. boulardii group) allowing the calculation of the duration of diarrhoea. RESULTS: The mean duration of diarrhoea was 6.16 days (range 2-13 days) in the placebo group and 4.70 days (range 2-10 days) in the S. boulardii group (p<0.05). On the 4th day, the patients in the S. boulardii group passed 2.5+/-1.4 stools/day versus 3.5+/-1.8 in the placebo group (p<0.001). The risk of having diarrhoea lasting more than 7 days was lower in the S. boulardii group (3/44 versus 12/44; RR 0.25; 95% CI 0.1-0.8). In no patient diarrhoea persisted longer than 14 days. A statistically significant difference was observed in the number of stools on the 4th and 7th day favouring the subgroup that received early treatment (within the first 48 h of the onset of diarrhoea). The administration of antibiotics before inclusion did not make any difference. CONCLUSION: S. boulardii as an adjuvant to ORS in ambulatory care in children less than 2 years old with mild or moderate acute diarrhoea decreased the duration of diarrhoea, accelerated recovery and reduced the risk of prolonged diarrhoea. The data also indicate increased efficacy if S. boulardii is administered within the first 48 h of the onset of diarrhoea. <EV> <t> Efficacy of high-dose Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in controlling acute watery diarrhea in Indian children: a randomized controlled trial. <abs> AIM: To evaluate the effective dose of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) as probiotic in acute watery diarrhea (AWD) in Indian children. SETTING: Hospital-based study. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, blinded trial. METHODS: All patients of AWD admitted over 1 year were included in the study. They were randomized into 3 groups to receive either only oral rehydration solution (ORS) (group A/control), ORS+LGG powder containing 10(10) colony forming units (CFU) (group B), or ORS+LGG powder containing 10(12) CFU (group C) twice daily for a minimum period of 7 days or until diarrhea stopped along with correction of dehydration. None of them received any other drug such as antibiotic or antidiarrheal medication. The duration and frequency of diarrhea and vomiting were studied. Data were analyzed by SPSS-10 software. RESULTS: The study comprised of 559 patients, group A/controls (n=185), group B (n=188), and group C (n=186). All the groups were similar with respect to age, number of breastfed infants, presentation with dehydration, degree of protein energy malnutrition, and rotavirus infection. The frequency and duration of diarrhea, requirement for intravenous therapy, and hospital stay were significantly lower in both the intervention groups compared with the controls. There was no significant difference between the 2 intervention groups. No complication was observed from the doses of LGG used. CONCLUSIONS: Both the doses of LGG (10(10) and 10(12) CFU) were equally effective to decrease the frequency and duration of diarrhea and reduction in hospital stay in patients of AWD. <EV> <t> Randomized double blinded controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bifilac in patients with acute viral diarrhea. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bifilac on reducing the episodes (frequency) and duration of diarrhea induced by rotaviral infection and to evaluate the efficacy of Bifilac to ameliorate the associated symptoms like dehydration and duration of rotaviral shedding in faeces. METHODS: 80 children aged between 3 months and 3 years were enrolled and divided into 2 groups, one group received standard therapy + placebo, the other group received standard therapy + probiotic (Bifilac) randomly. Children assessed for frequency and duration of diarrhea. Degree of dehydration, duration and volume of oral rehydration salt [ORS] therapy, duration and volume of Intra venous fluids and duration of rotaviral shedding. RESULTS: When compared to the placebo, Bifilac showed clinical as well as statistically significant reduction in Number of episodes (frequency) of diarrhea in a day, mean duration of diarrhea (in days) degree of dehydration, duration and volume of oral rehydration salt [ORS] therapy, duration and volume of intravenous fluid [IVF] therapy, duration of rotaviral shedding (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The synbiotic, bifilac, appears to be a safe and very effective adjuvant in the management of acute rotaviral diarrhea. <EV> <t> Evaluation of yogurt effect on acute diarrhea in 6-24-month-old hospitalized infants. <abs> Yogurt helps in treatment and prevention of diarrhea. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of consumption of local factory yogurt, which is made with pasteurized milk, on moderately dehydrated hospitalized infants aged 6-24 months with acute non-bloody and non-mucoid diarrhea. Eighty moderately dehydrated breast-feeding children aged between 6-24 months with acute non-bloody and non-mucoid diarrhea for fewer than four days were included in the study. Patients were randomly separated into two groups according to their treatment. Infants in the case group received at least 15 ml/kg/day of pasteurized cow milk yogurt orally plus routine hospital treatment. Infants in the control group received routine hospital treatment as in the case group. Weight gains, period of hospitalization, and reduction in diarrhea frequency during hospitalization period of the two groups were compared. Mean duration of hospitalization (days), weight gain, and reduction in diarrhea frequency were 2.7 +/- 0.91 vs 3.1 +/- 0.74 days, 435 +/- 89.20 vs 383 +/- 98.9 g, and 4.30 +/- 1.74 vs 3.60 +/- 1.23 times for case and control groups, respectively. Significant differences were observed in mean hospitalization days (p=0.035), reduction in diarrhea frequency (p=0.049) and weight gain (p=0.017). This study recommends universal use of yogurt in acute non-bloody diarrhea. <EV> <t> Probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 versus placebo for treating diarrhea of greater than 4 days duration in infants and toddlers. <abs> BACKGROUND: Administering probiotics can prevent or cure some forms of diarrhea. The efficacy of probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) in infants and toddlers with diarrhea >4 days was tested by a double-blind trial. METHODS: One hundred fifty-one children aged 1-47 months with nonspecific diarrhea were randomized to receive either EcN suspension (N = 75) or placebo (N = 76). Diarrhea had to meet the following definition: >3 watery or loose nonbloody stools in 24 hours of a diarrheal episode persisting for >4 consecutive days but < or =14 days. All children were well nourished or only moderately malnourished, mildly dehydrated, and received oral rehydration at study commencement. They were treated orally with 1-3 mL EcN suspension (1 mL contains 10 viable cells) or placebo daily for 21 days. Primary objective was to confirm a better response rate (reduction of daily stool frequency to < or =3 watery or loose stools over > or =4 days) with EcN. RESULTS: The 7-day response was higher for the EcN group than placebo (EcN 78.7%, placebo 59.2%). Significant differences were observed on days 14 (EcN 93.3%, placebo 65.8%, P = 0.0017) and 21 (EcN 98.7%, placebo 71.1%, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis resulted in a significant difference of 3.3 days between the groups (P < 0.0001); median time to response for EcN was 2.4 and 5.7 for placebo. EcN was safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In the conditions of this trial EcN was a suitable remedy for diarrhea >4 days in young children. <EV> <t> Probiotics have clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic efficacy in acute infectious diarrhea. <abs> BACKGROUND: Acute infectious diarrhea is a major cause of childhood morbidity and economic burden for families. We evaluate the clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic effects of probiotics in acute infectious diarrhea. METHODS: Children (n = 304) aged 3 months to 6 years hospitalized for acute diarrhea were randomized to receive Bio-three (a mixture of Bacillus mesentericus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Clostridium butyricum) or placebo orally 3 times daily for 7 days. Fecal samples were homogenized for bacterial culture and blood cells were isolated for cell culture and cytokine analysis. This study is registered (NCT00463190). RESULTS: The mean duration of diarrhea after start of therapy was 60.1 hours in the probiotics group versus 86.3 hours in the placebo group (P = 0.003). Hospital stay was shorter in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (P = 0.009). Counts of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus species were elevated in stool culture of the probiotics (Bio-three) group. IL-10 was increased in the serum and supernatants of cell culture in the probiotics group, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha values were down-regulated. Interferon- gamma and IL-12 were mildly elevated in the probiotics group, compared with the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: This probiotics mixture reduced the severity of diarrhea and length of hospital stay in children with acute diarrhea. In addition to restoring beneficial intestinal flora, probiotics may enhance host protective immunity such as down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines. <EV> <t> Randomized control trial of live Lactobacillus acidophilus plus Bifidobacterium infantis in treatment of infantile acute watery diarrhea. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of live Lactobacillus acidophilus plus Bifidobacterium infantis in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea. DESIGN: Open, randomized control trial. SETTING: King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Seventy-one infants (aged 1-24 months) with acute watery diarrhea that presented at Department of Pediatrics, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok were enrolled after parental signed informed consent. They were randomized into 2 groups. The Study group (n = 35) received live Lactobacillus plus Bifidobacterium (3 x 10(9) CFU) bid and ORS and the Control group (n = 36) received ORS only. All infants received lactose free milk. Case record forms were completed daily for 5 days by the parents. RESULTS: All 71 infants completed the present study. There was no difference of the patients'characteristics and baseline clinical symptoms between the study group and the control group. Live Lactobacillus plus Bifidobacterium shortened the diarrhea duration (1.6 +/- 0.7 days vs 2.9 +/- 1.7 days, p < 0.01) compared to controls. However the stool frequency and duration of hospitalization were not significantly different (p > 0.05, study group vs control group). CONCLUSION: Live Lactobacillus acidophilus plus Bifidobacterium infantis may be an effective treatment for acute watery diarrhea in infants. The 2-day course treatment can significantly shorten the duration of diarrhea. <EV> <t> Efficacy of tyndalized Lactobacillus acidophilus in acute diarrhea. <abs> OBJECTIVE: A double-blind randomized controlled-trial was done to evaluate the efficacy of tyndalized Lactobacillus acidophilus in acute diarrhea. METHODS: All children from 6 months to 12 years with acute diarrhea were included. Lactobacillus acidophilus/placebo was given to the children for 3 days with ORS and feeds. Intake-output was recorded 4 hourly. Of the 98 children, 48 received lactobacillus and 50 the placebo. RESULTS: ORS consumed, frequency of stools, duration of diarrhea, time for rehydration, hospital stay, weight gain and IVF needed were comparable in the two study groups. There were 4 treatment failures in the lactobacillus group and none in the placebo group (OR 0.92, 95%CI 0.84-0.99). In the rotaviral diarrhea and in those who had diarrhea of less then 60 hours the difference did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: There is no significant benefit of tyndalized Lactobacillus acidophilus in acute diarrhea. <EV> <t> Effects of Saccharomyces boulardii in children with acute diarrhoea. <abs> AIM: Certain probiotic agents, e.g. Lactobacillus GG, have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the treatment of acute childhood diarrhoea, but few studies have examined the effect of Saccharomyces boulardii. We evaluated the effect of S. boulardii in children with acute diarrhoea. METHODS: Two hundred children were randomized to receive S. boulardii in a granulated form in a daily dose of 250 mg (S. boulardii group) or placebo (placebo group) for 5 d. Clinical and demographic characteristics on admission were similar between the study groups. RESULTS: The medians of the average stool frequency after the second day of the treatment were significantly lower in the S. boulardii group than in the placebo group (p = 0.003). The duration of diarrhoea significantly reduced in the S. boulardii group compared with the placebo group (4.7 vs 5.5 d, p = 0.03). The effect of S. boulardii on watery diarrhoea became apparent after the second day of the treatment. The duration of hospital stay was shorter in the S. boulardii group than in the placebo group (2.9 vs 3.9 d, p < 0.001). Four children from the placebo group versus only one child from the S. boulardii group had persisting diarrhoea. CONCLUSION: The placebo-controlled study suggested that S. boulardii significantly reduced the duration of acute diarrhoea and the duration of hospital stay. S. boulardii seems to be a promising agent for the amelioration of the course of acute diarrhoea in children when used therapeutically. <EV> <t> Treatment of acute infectious diarrhoea in infants and children with a mixture of three Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains--a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Multiple studies document that probiotics are effective in treating infectious diarrhoea in children. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is the most extensively studied but effectiveness of other strains has been poorly examined. AIM: To determine whether L. rhamnosus strains (573L/1; 573L/2; 573L/3) (Lakcid L, Biomed, Lublin, Poland) would be effective in shortening infectious diarrhoea. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 87 children (age range: 2 months to 6 years) with infectious diarrhoea were administered Lakcid L at a dose 1.2 x 10(10) CFU or placebo, twice daily, for 5 days. Primary outcome measure was the duration of diarrhoea. Secondary measures were duration of parenteral rehydration, adverse events, and gastrointestinal tract colonization by administered strains. RESULTS: In an intention to treat analysis of 87 children, the mean duration of diarrhoea in the treated group: 84 +/- 56 h; placebo: 96 +/- 72 h (P = 0.36). In rotavirus infection: 76 +/- 35 h vs. 115 +/- 67 h (P = 0.03), respectively. Duration of parenteral rehydration: 15 +/- 14 h vs. 38 +/- 33 h (P = 0.006). Gut colonization by administered strains was 80% and 41% at five and 14 days, respectively. No adverse events were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of L. rhamnosus strains shortens the duration of rotaviral diarrhoea in children but not of diarrhoea of any aetiology. Intervention shortens the time of intravenous rehydration.", "summary:reference": "Used alongside rehydration therapy, probiotics appear to be safe and have clear beneficial effects in shortening the duration and reducing stool frequency in acute infectious diarrhoea.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Resorbable cement for the augmentation of internally-fixed unstable trochanteric fractures. A prospective, randomised multicentre study. <abs> We undertook a multicentre, prospective study of a series of 112 unstable trochanteric fractures in order to evaluate if internal fixation with a sliding screw device combined with augmentation using a calcium phosphate degradable cement (Norian SRS) could improve the clinical, functional and radiological outcome when compared with fractures treated with a sliding screw device alone. Pain, activities of daily living, health status (SF-36), the strength of the hip abductor muscles and radiological outcome were analysed. Six weeks after surgery, the patients in the augmented group had significantly lower global and functional pain scores (p < 0.003), less pain after walking 50 feet (p < 0.01), and a better return to the activities of daily living (p < 0.05). At follow-up at six weeks and six months, those in the augmented group showed a significant improvement compared with the control group in the SF-36 score. No other significant differences were found between the groups. We conclude that augmentation with calcium phosphate cement in unstable trochanteric fractures provides a modest reduction in pain and a slight improvement in the quality of life during the course of healing when compared with conventional fixation with a sliding screw device alone. <EV> <t> HA-coated screws decrease the incidence of fixation failure in osteoporotic trochanteric fractures. <abs> This study was done to determine if elderly patients with trochanteric fractures and with osteoporosis could benefit from treatment with a dynamic hip screw fixed with HA-coated AO/ASIF screws. One hundred twenty patients with AO, A1, or A2 trochanteric fractures were selected. Patients were divided into two groups and randomized to receive a 135 degree-four-hole dynamic hip screw fixed with either standard lag and cortical AO/ASIF screws (Group A), or HA-coated lag and cortical AO/ASIF screws (Group B). Lag screw cutout occurred in four patients in Group A, but not in any patients in Group B. In Group A, the femoral neck shaft angle was 134 degrees +/- 5 degrees postoperatively and 127 degrees +/- 12 degrees at 6 months. In Group B, the femoral neck shaft angle was 134 degrees +/- 7 degrees postoperatively and 133 degrees +/- 7 degrees at 6 months. The Harris hip score at 6 months was 60 +/- 25 in Group A and 71 +/- 18 in Group B. The superior results of Group B can be attributed to the increased screw fixation provided by the HA-coated screws. We recommend lag screws coated with HA for dynamic hip screw fixation, especially in osteoporotic bone. <EV> <t> Unstable trochanteric fractures augmented with calcium phosphate cement. A prospective randomized study using radiostereometry to measure fracture stability. <abs> BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Internally fixed unstable trochanteric fractures might be difficult to retain in position during healing. Secondary displacement might lead to malunion and poor functional result. The aim with this study was to measure whether augmentation with resorbable calcium-phosphate cement could improve fracture stability as shown in biomechanical studies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 26 ambulatory patients with an unstable trochanteric fracture were randomized to treatment with a sliding screw device alone (Controls) or the same device combined with calcium-phosphate cement for augmentation (Augmented). All patients were allowed unrestricted weight bearing after surgery. Fracture movement was measured with radiostereometry (RSA) at 1 and 6 weeks and at 6 months. RESULTS: Two patients died during the study period due to unrelated causes and another three were excluded due to technical problems with the RSA in two and concomitant illness in one. 21 patients (11 Augmented and 10 Controls) were followed according to the study protocol. At 1 week the augmented fractures had moved on average 1.9+/-1.7 mm while movement in the controls was 4.0+/-2.4 mm (p < 0.05). The average total movement from the day after surgery until 6 months, when all fractures had healed, was 7.8+/-6.2 mm for the augmented fractures and 13.2+/-4.3 mm for the controls (p < 0.05). Varus angulation was the most pronounced rotational movement for both groups although augmented fractures revealed less varus angulation compared with controls at all time points. Rotation around the longitudinal and transversal axes were small with no significant differences between treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Augmentation with calcium-phosphate cement improved the stability of unstable trochanteric fractures fixed with a sliding screw device. The improvement was most pronounced for varus angulation and lateral and distal migration of the head and neck fragment.", "summary:reference": "There is inadequate evidence to support the use of osteotomy for internal fixation of a trochanteric hip fracture.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Clinical efficacy of anti-pneumococcal vaccination in patients with COPD. <abs> BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) in immunocompetent patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was carried out in 596 patients with COPD of mean (SD) age 65.8 (9.7) years, 298 of whom received PPV. The main outcome was radiographically proven community acquired pneumonia (CAP) of pneumococcal or unknown aetiology after a mean period of 979 days (range 20-1454). RESULTS: There were 58 first episodes of CAP caused by pneumococcus or of unknown aetiology, 25 in the intervention group and 33 in the non-intervention group. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for CAP did not show significant differences between the intervention and non-intervention arms (log rank test = 1.15, p = 0.28) in the whole group of patients. The efficacy of PPV in all patients was 24% (95% CI -24 to 54; p = 0.333). In the subgroup aged <65 years the efficacy of PPV was 76% (95% CI 20 to 93; p = 0.013), while in those with severe functional obstruction (forced expiratory volume in 1 second <40%) it was 48% (95% CI -7 to 80; p = 0.076). In younger patients with severe airflow obstruction the efficacy was 91% (95% CI 35 to 99; p = 0.002). There were only five cases of non-bacteraemic pneumococcal CAP, all in the non-intervention group (log rank test = 5.03; p = 0.025). Multivariate analysis gave a hazard ratio for unknown and pneumococcal CAP in the vaccinated group, adjusted for age, of 0.20 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.68; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: PPV is effective in preventing CAP in patients with COPD aged less than 65 years and in those with severe airflow obstruction. No differences were found among the other groups of patients with COPD. <EV> <t> Additive effect of pneumococcal vaccine and influenza vaccine on acute exacerbation in patients with chronic lung disease. <abs> To determine the clinical efficacy of combined vaccination with 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PV) and influenza vaccine (IV) against pneumonia and acute exacerbation of chronic lung diseases (CLD), we conducted an open-label, randomized, controlled study among 167 adults with CLD over a 2-year period. Subjects were randomly assigned to a PV+IV group (n=87) or an IV group (n=80). The number of patients with CLD experiencing infectious acute exacerbation (P=0.022), but not pneumonia (P=0.284), was significantly lower in the PV+IV group compared with the IV group. When these subjects were divided into subgroups, an additive effect of PV with IV in preventing infectious acute exacerbation was significant only in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (P=0.037). In patients with CLD, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated a significant difference for infectious acute exacerbation (P=0.016) between the two groups. An additive effect of PV with IV on infectious acute exacerbation was found during the first year after vaccination (P=0.019), but not during the second year (P=0.342), and was associated with serotype-specific immune response in sera of these patients who used PV during the same period. <EV> <t> Response to pneumococcal vaccine in chronic obstructive lung disease--the effect of ongoing, systemic steroid treatment. <abs> Forty-nine patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) were block-randomized in four groups to investigate, if different degrees of steroid-load influenced the effect of pneumococcal-vaccination on antibody level and clinical variables during 6 months of follow-up. The groups included 13 patients without systemic steroids for the previous 3 months, all vaccinated at entrance in the study and treated with steroids for 4 weeks. Nine patients had chronic steroid treatment both before and during the investigation; they were vaccinated at the entrance in the study. Fifteen patients without systemic steroids for the previous 3 months were vaccinated after the end of a 4-week steroid treatment. Twelve patients served as controls, and were not vaccinated. Totally, 60%-78% of vaccinated patients in the three groups had a rise in antibody level, and a later decrease compared to two of the 12 control patients (p<0.01). This difference was also significant (p<0.05) for the patients vaccinated at entrance in the hospital. No differences were observed among the clinical variables: pneumonia, exacerbations, admittance to hospital, increase in the use of steroids or beta-agonists, and the use of antibiotics. We conclude that a rise in antibody level after pneumococcal vaccination can be expected in patients with COPD despite of the use of systemic steroids.

METHODS: We randomly assigned 2499 HIV-seronegative men or transgender women who have sex with men to receive a combination of two oral antiretroviral drugs, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC-TDF), or placebo once daily. All subjects received HIV testing, risk-reduction counseling, condoms, and management of sexually transmitted infections. RESULTS: The study subjects were followed for 3324 person-years (median, 1.2 years; maximum, 2.8 years).

{"document": "<EV> <t> Fast assessment of stroke and transient ischaemic attack to prevent early recurrence (FASTER): a randomised controlled pilot trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Patients with transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke are at high immediate risk of stroke. The optimum early treatment options for these patients are not known. METHODS: Within 24 h of symptom onset, we randomly assigned, in a factorial design, 392 patients with TIA or minor stroke to clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose then 75 mg daily; 198 patients) or placebo (194 patients), and simvastatin (40 mg daily; 199 patients) or placebo (193 patients). All patients were also given aspirin and were followed for 90 days. Descriptive analyses were done by intention to treat. The primary outcome was total stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic) within 90 days. Safety outcomes included haemorrhage related to clopidogrel and myositis related to simvastatin. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial (number 35624812) and with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00109382). FINDINGS: The median time to stroke outcome was 1 day (range 0-62 days). The trial was stopped early due to a failure to recruit patients at the prespecified minimum enrolment rate because of increased use of statins. 14 (7.1%) patients on clopidogrel had a stroke within 90 days compared with 21 (10.8%) patients on placebo (risk ratio 0.7 [95% CI 0.3-1.2]; absolute risk reduction -3.8% [95% CI -9.4 to 1.9]; p=0.19). 21 (10.6%) patients on simvastatin had a stroke within 90 days compared with 14 (7.3%) patients on placebo (risk ratio 1.3 [0.7-2.4]; absolute risk increase 3.3% [-2.3 to 8.9]; p=0.25). The interaction between clopidogrel and simvastatin was not significant (p=0.64). Two patients on clopidogrel had intracranial haemorrhage compared with none on placebo (absolute risk increase 1.0% [-0.4 to 2.4]; p=0.5). There was no difference between groups for the simvastatin safety outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Immediately after TIA or minor stroke, patients are at high risk of stroke, which might be reduced by using clopidogrel in addition to aspirin. The haemorrhagic risks of the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel do not seem to offset this potential benefit. We were unable to provide evidence of benefit of simvastatin in this setting. This aggressive prevention approach merits further study. <EV> <t> High-dose atorvastatin after stroke or transient ischemic attack. <abs> BACKGROUND: Statins reduce the incidence of strokes among patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease; whether they reduce the risk of stroke after a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) remains to be established. METHODS: We randomly assigned 4731 patients who had had a stroke or TIA within one to six months before study entry, had low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of 100 to 190 mg per deciliter (2.6 to 4.9 mmol per liter), and had no known coronary heart disease to double-blind treatment with 80 mg of atorvastatin per day or placebo. The primary end point was a first nonfatal or fatal stroke. RESULTS: The mean LDL cholesterol level during the trial was 73 mg per deciliter (1.9 mmol per liter) among patients receiving atorvastatin and 129 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter) among patients receiving placebo. During a median follow-up of 4.9 years, 265 patients (11.2 percent) receiving atorvastatin and 311 patients (13.1 percent) receiving placebo had a fatal or nonfatal stroke (5-year absolute reduction in risk, 2.2 percent; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to 0.99; P=0.03; unadjusted P=0.05). The atorvastatin group had 218 ischemic strokes and 55 hemorrhagic strokes, whereas the placebo group had 274 ischemic strokes and 33 hemorrhagic strokes. The five-year absolute reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events was 3.5 percent (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.92; P=0.002). The overall mortality rate was similar, with 216 deaths in the atorvastatin group and 211 deaths in the placebo group (P=0.98), as were the rates of serious adverse events. Elevated liver enzyme values were more common in patients taking atorvastatin. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recent stroke or TIA and without known coronary heart disease, 80 mg of atorvastatin per day reduced the overall incidence of strokes and of cardiovascular events, despite a small increase in the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Effectiveness of a glass ionomer cement used as a pit and fissure sealant in recently erupted permanent first molars. <abs> PURPOSE: This study's purpose was to evaluate the caries-preventive effect of a glass ionomer cement (GIC) used as an occlusal sealant on recently erupted permanent first molars. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, controlled, clinical trial was undertaken that included 36 5- to 8-year-olds (and 92 permanent first molars) who were randomly allocated to the test group (GIC) or the control group (auto-polymerized resin-based sealant [RBS]). The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the number of new carious or filled occlusal surfaces in the 2 groups. RESULTS: After 6 months, 1 occlusal surface in the test group and 2 occlusal surfaces in the control group showed carious lesions (P=.15). In the fifth year of follow-up, 2 occlusal surfaces in the test group and 7 occlusal surfaces in the control group were filled or carious (P=.42), and the mean number of sealed surfaces that became carious or filled was 0.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.02-0.70) for the GIC-sealed teeth and 0.6 (95% CI=0.20-1.30) for the RBS-sealed teeth (P=.30). CONCLUSION: High-viscosity glass ionomer cement can provide some level of protection against dental caries when used as a dental sealant in newly erupted permanent first molars. <EV> <t> Comparing the caries-preventive effect of two fissure sealing modalities in public health care: a single application of glass ionomer and a routine resin-based sealant programme. A randomized split-mouth clinical trial. <abs> AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the caries-preventive effect of two types of sealant modalities and to evaluate whether the caries-preventive effect is related to sealant retention. A hypothesis was tested in which a glass ionomer sealant, once applied to the occlusal surface, was able to protect the fissure from caries even if the sealant appeared lost at visual inspection. DESIGN: A 3-year randomized split-mouth trial evaluating two sealant modalities was performed at a public health centre in Finland. A chemically curing glass ionomer cement (GIC) and light-curing resin-based (RB) sealant material were applied randomly to the permanent second molars. Sealant application as a routine treatment procedure was carried out to 599 children in the age group of 12-16 years. Caries rate of the sealed teeth and sealant retention with both materials were analysed by a modified McNemar's test. The effectiveness, rate difference, and relative risk with both sealant materials were measured. RESULTS: The difference in caries rate between the two modalities was highly significant. When compared to the GIC sealant method, the effectiveness of RB sealant method was 74.1% and the rate difference 3.2% (95% CI 1.44%, 4.98%). The relative risk for RB-sealed surfaces vs. GIC-sealed surfaces of having detectable dentin caries was 0.26 (95% CI 0.12, 0.57). The retention rate of sealants was higher with RB than GIC (P < 0.001). The effectiveness of the retention rate for RB sealants was 94.8% and the rate difference 87.2% (95% CI 83.86%, 90.50%). The relative risk during the 3-year study period of having a defective or lost RB sealant was 0.052 (95% CI 0.036, 0.075) when compared to having a defective or lost GIC sealant. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that in preventing dentin caries a RB sealant programme including resealing when necessary was more effective than a single application of GIC. The original hypothesis was thus falsified. <EV> <t> Evaluation of resin based and glass ionomer based sealants placed with or without tooth preparation-a two year clinical trial. <abs> PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the two year clinical performance of two fissure sealants, placed with and without tooth preparation. METHODS: A total of 25 children, between 6-10 years of age, had sealants placed and evaluated for two years at six monthly intervals. All the four first permanent molars of each patient were used in split mouth design and subjected to two different sealants with and without tooth preparation. Teeth were evaluated for defects, retention and development of caries. RESULTS: Among the teeth subjected to preparation, 60% of those sealed with glass ionomers and 32% of those sealed with resin sealants showed total loss of sealants at the end of two years. Among the teeth sealed with no preparation, 100% of those sealed with glass ionomers and 80% of those sealed with resin showed total loss. Resin based sealants offered better long term retention compared to glass ionomer-based fissure sealants. Tooth preparation improved the retention of sealants irrespective of the material used. Highest retention was seen in resin sealants with tooth preparation, and lowest retention was seen in glass ionomer-based sealants without preparation. There was a significant increase in caries in teeth sealed after preparation with either material. Teeth sealed with resin sealants exhibited significantly higher caries development compared to teeth sealed with glass ionomers. CONCLUSION: In the current study, resin-based sealants were found to be superior to glass ionomer-based sealants, and tooth preparation improved retention. Loss of sealants seemed to predispose tooth to development of caries, especially in cases where teeth preparation was done. <EV> <t> Caries-preventive efficacy and retention of a resin-modified glass ionomer cement and a resin-based fissure sealant: a 3-year split-mouth randomised clinical trial. <abs> PURPOSE: This prospective clinical trial compared the retention rate and caries-preventive efficacy of two types of sealant modalities over a 3-year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a split-mouth randomised design, 1280 sealants were randomly applied on sound permanent second molars of 320 young patients aged between 12 and 16 years. Half of the teeth (n = 640) were sealed with a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC) (Vitremer, 3M ESPE) and the other half (n = 640) with a conventional light-cure, resin-based fissure sealant (LCRB) (Fluoroshield(R), Dentsply Caulk). Teeth were evaluated at baseline, 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, 30- and 36-month intervals with regard to retention and new caries development. RESULTS: On the sealed occlusal surfaces after 3 years, 5.10% of RMGIC and 91.08% of LCRB sealants were totally intact and 6.37% of RMGIC and 7.65% of LCRB sealants were partially intact. New caries lesions were found in 20.06% of RMGIC sealed occlusal surfaces, compared to 8.91% for LCRB sealants. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present clinical study suggest that RMGIC should be used only as a transitional sealant that can be applied to newly erupting teeth throughout the eruptive process, whereas LCRB sealants are used to successfully prevent occlusal caries lesions once an effective rubber dam can be achieved. It can be concluded that there are differences between the RMGIC and LCRB sealants over a 3-year period in terms of the retention rate and caries-preventive efficacy. RMGIC can serve as a simple and economic sealing solution, however provisional. Due to its poor retention rate, periodic recalls are necessary, even after 6 months, to eventually replace the lost sealant. <EV> <t> Clinical and antibacterial effectiveness of three different sealant materials. <abs> PURPOSE: The aim of this work is to study and compare the retention rate, caries-preventing and antibacterial effects of resin-modified glass ionomer and flowable composite in comparison to conventional fissure sealant. METHODS: Forty-five children aged 7-10 years with newly erupted lower first permanent molars were randomly divided into three equal treatment groups. Group I: sealed by a conventional resin sealant; Group II: sealed by resin modified glass ionomer (RMGI); and Group III: sealed by flowable composite. Retention and caries status of the sealed teeth were recorded after 1 month, 6 months, year and 2 years. In addition, Streptococcus mutans counts were assessed at baseline, 1 day, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after sealant application. Data were analyzed by Fisher exact, chi-square and ANOVA tests. RESULTS: Group III and Group I showed significantly higher retention rates than Group II fissure sealant (p<0.05). There were no differences of the caries-preventive effects between the tested sealant materials throughout the duration of the study. Streptococcus mutans counts were significantly lower in group II compared to group I or group III up to 6 months of the study (p<0.05). After 1 year of the study the differences of Streptococcus mutans counts were not significant (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: This study indicated a lower retention of RMGI compared to flowable composite and resin sealant without significant difference in caries prevention or long-term bacterial inhibition. <EV> <t> Randomized trial on fluorides and sealants for fissure caries prevention. <abs> To investigate the effectiveness of topical fluorides in preventing fissure caries, we conducted a randomized controlled trial with parallel groups. In total, 501 children (1,539 molars, 3,078 sites), mean age 9.1 years, who had at least one sound permanent first molar with deep fissures or fissures with signs of early caries were recruited. They were randomly allocated among four groups: (1) resin sealant, single placement; (2) 5% NaF varnish, semi-annual application; (3) 38% silver diamine fluoride (SDF) solution, annual application; and (4) placebo control. Follow-up examinations were conducted every 6 months by a masked examiner. After 24 months, 485 children (97%) were examined. Proportions of pit/fissure sites with dentin caries in the sealant, NaF, SDF, and control groups were 1.6%, 2.4%, 2.2%, and 4.6%, respectively. A multi-level logistic regression analysis accounting for the effects of data clustering and confounding factors showed that fissures in any of the three treatment groups had significantly lower risks of carious cavity development into dentin than did controls (p < 0.05). We concluded that placement of resin sealant, semi-annual application of NaF varnish, and annual application of SDF solution are all effective in preventing pit and fissure caries in permanent molars (ClinicalTrials.gov number CT01446107). <EV> <t> Caries-preventive effect of sealants produced with altered glass-ionomer materials, after 2 years. <abs> OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the caries-preventive effect of sealants produced with a high-viscosity glass-ionomer with an elevated powder-liquid ratio (ART), of having energy added to this glass-ionomer, and that of glass-carbomer, in comparison to that of resin composite sealants. METHODS: The randomized controlled trial covered 407 children, with a mean age of 8 years. At a school compound three dentists placed sealants in pits and fissures of high caries-risk children. Evaluation by two independent evaluators was conducted after 0.5, 1 and 2 years. The Kaplan-Meier survival method, ANOVA and t-test were used in analyzing the data. RESULTS: 1352 first permanent molars were sealed. 6.6% of children and 6.8% of sealants dropped out within 2 years. 27 re-exposed pits and fissures, 20 in occlusal and 7 in smooth surfaces, in 25 children, developed a dentin carious lesion. The cumulative survival of dentin carious lesion-free pits and fissures in the glass-carbomer sealant group was statistically significantly lower (97.4%) than those in the high-viscosity glass-ionomer with energy supplied (99%) and the resin-composite (98.9%) sealant groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the cumulative survival of dentin carious lesion-free pits and fissures, between the high-viscosity glass-ionomer with (99%) and without (98.3%) energy supplied sealant groups, after 2 years. SIGNIFICANCE: The survival of dentin carious lesion-free pits and fissures was high in all sealant types. More dentin carious lesions were observed in the glass-carbomer sealant group. <EV> <t> Occlusal caries prevention in high and low risk schoolchildren.

METHODS: The children were followed-up for 24 months after being systematically allocated into six groups as follows: Control Groups HRC and LRC: children receiving oral health education (OHE) every 3 months; Groups HRV and LRV: children receiving OHE plus varnish application biannually; and Groups HRS and LRS: children receiving OHE plus a single sealant application . The baseline and follow-up examinations were performed by the same calibrated dentist under natural light, using CPI probes and mirrors, after toothbrushing and air-drying. The DMFS was used to record dental caries, in addition to the detection of initial lesions (IL). Data analysis was performed with two primary outcome measures: DMF and DMF+ IL on the OSPFM. RESULTS: After 24 months, only the HRS group showed statistically lower DMF and DMF+IL increments on OSPFM compared with HRC group. HRV group did not differ from HRC and HRS groups.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding versus open vertical banded gastroplasty: a prospective randomized trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) and open vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) are treatment modalities for morbid obesity. However, few prospective randomized clinical trials (RCT) have been performed to compare both operations. METHODS: 100 patients (50 per group) were included in the study. Postoperative outcomes included hospital length of stay (LOS), complications, percent excess weight loss (%EWL), BMI and reduction in total comorbidities. Follow-up in all patients was 2 years. RESULTS: LOS was significantly shorter in the LAGB group. 3 LAGB were converted to open (1 to gastric bypass). Directly after VBG, 3 patients needed relaparotomies due to leakage, of which one (2%) died. After 2 years, 100% follow-up was achieved. BMI and %EWL were significantly decreased in both groups but significantly more in the VBG group compared to the LAGB group (31.0 kg/m2 and 70.1% vs 34.6 and 54.9% respectively). Co-morbidities significantly decreased in both groups in time. 2 years after LAGB, 20 patients needed reoperation for pouch dilation/slippage (n=12), band leakage (n=2), band erosion (n=2) and access-port problems (n=4). In the VBG group, 18 patients needed revisional surgery due to staple-line disruption (n=15), narrow outlet (n=2) or insufficient weight loss (n=1). Furthermore, 8 VBG patients developed an incisional hernia. CONCLUSION: This RCT demonstrates that, despite the initial better weight loss in the VBG group, based on complication rates and clinical outcome, LAGB is preferred. It had a shorter LOS and less postoperative morbidity. <EV> <t> Randomized clinical trial of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus laparoscopic vertical banded gastroplasty for obesity. <abs> BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic techniques have been developed for performing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) and vertical banded gastroplasty (LVBG) in patients with morbid obesity. It is not certain, however, which is the better technique in non-superobese patients (body mass index less than 50 kg/m(2)). METHODS: Eighty-three patients (LRYGBP 37, LVBG 46) were assessed in a randomized clinical trial. Perioperative complications were recorded together with preoperative and postoperative respiratory function and mobilization rate. Patients were monitored for 2 years after operation with regard to weight change and the need for remedial surgery. RESULTS: There were no conversions to open surgery. The mean operating time was longer for LRYGBP than LVBG (138 versus 105 min). Five early reoperations were performed after LRYGBP (three for haemorrhage, one for ileus and one suspected leak) and one after LVBG (suspected leak). There were no differences in postoperative respiratory function or mobilization. Weight reduction was greater after LRYGBP (excess weight loss 78.3 versus 62.9 per cent 1 year after surgery, P = 0.009; 84.4 versus 59.8 per cent at 2 years, P < 0.001). Remedial surgical intervention was required in eight patients after LVBG (conversion to Roux-en-Ygastric bypass) and none after LRYGBP. CONCLUSION: LRYGBP and LVBG were comparable in terms of operative safety and postoperative recovery, but weight reduction was better after LRYGBP. <EV> <t> Changes of body weight and plasma ghrelin levels after gastric banding and gastric bypass. <abs> OBJECTIVE: Ghrelin is an enteric peptide with strong orexigenic and adipogenic effects. Plasma ghrelin levels are decreased in obese subjects but increase after weight loss; this increase is not observed after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Prospective and comparative data after adjustable silicone gastric banding (ASGB) have not been reported previously. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Overnight fasting plasma ghrelin concentration was measured in morbidly obese subjects at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after ASGB (n = 8) or RYGB (n = 5) and in nonoperated controls (n = 7). RESULTS: After RYGB, body weight (BW) decreased by 29.5 +/- 5.5 kg (mean +/- SE, p < 0.001), whereas plasma ghrelin failed to increase significantly (+167 +/- 119 pg/mL, not significant). In contrast, after ASGB, BW decreased less (by 22.8 +/- 5.9 kg; p < 0.001), and plasma ghrelin significantly increased by 377 +/- 201 pg/mL (p = 0.025). Neither BW nor plasma ghrelin changed in nonoperated controls. Plasma leptin decreased in both operated groups (similarly p < 0.05) but not in nonoperated controls. Plasma growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 were not correlated with changes in plasma ghrelin concentrations. DISCUSSION: Plasma ghrelin levels failed to increase during substantial weight loss after RYGB, but did increase in response to lesser weight loss after ASGB. These findings suggest that the plasma ghrelin response after weight loss is impaired after exclusion of major parts of the stomach and the duodenum (RYGB), and the smaller long-term weight loss after ASGB compared with RYGB may be due, at least in part, to an absent increase in plasma ghrelin after RYGB. <EV> <t> Laparoscopic versus open gastric bypass in the treatment of morbid obesity: a randomized prospective study. <abs> OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to compare the results of open versus laparoscopic gastric bypass in the treatment of morbid obesity. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Gastric bypass is one of the most commonly acknowledged surgical techniques for the management of morbid obesity. It is usually performed as an open surgery procedure, although now some groups perform it via the laparoscopic approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1999 and January 2002 we conducted a randomized prospective study in 104 patients diagnosed with morbid obesity. The patients were divided into 2 groups: 1 group with gastric bypass via the open approach (OGBP) comprising 51 patients, and 1 group with gastric bypass via the laparoscopic approach (LGBP) comprising 53 patients. The parameters compared were as follows: operating time, intraoperative complications, early (<30 days) and late (>30 days) postoperative complications, hospital stay, and short-term evolution of body mass index. RESULTS: Mean operating time was 186.4 minutes (125-290) in the LGBP group and 201.7 minutes (129-310) in the OGBP group (P < 0.05). Conversion to laparotomy was necessary in 8% of the LGBP patients. Early postoperative complications (<30 days) occurred in 22.6% of the LGBP group compared with 29.4% of the OGBP group, with no significant differences. Late complications (>30 days) occurred in 11% of the LGBP group compared with 24% of the OGBP group (P < 0.05). The differences observed between the 2 groups are the result of a high incidence of abdominal wall hernias in the OGBP group. Mean hospital stay was 5.2 days (1-13) in the LGBP group and 7.9 days (2-28) in the OGBP group (P < 0.05). Evolution of body mass index during a mean follow-up of 23 months was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: LGBP is a good surgical technique for the management of morbid obesity and has clear advantages over OGBP, such as a reduction in abdominal wall complications and a shorter hospital stay. The midterm weight loss is similar with both techniques. One inconvenience is that LGBP has a more complex learning curve than other advanced laparoscopic techniques, which may be associated with an increase in postoperative complications. <EV> <t> Randomized clinical trial of hand-assisted laparoscopic versus open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for the treatment of morbid obesity. <abs> BACKGROUND: : Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) has increased in popularity since the introduction of the laparoscopic procedure, but this approach requires extensive surgical skill and the learning curve is steep. The present study examined the suitability of hand-assisted laparoscopy for RYGBP. METHODS: In a prospective trial, 50 patients (median age 38 years, body mass index 45 kg/m(2)) were randomized to either hand-assisted (n = 25) or open (n = 25) RYGBP. The hand-assisted device was introduced through a right subcostal incision. Laparoscopic staplers were also used in the open group, allowing a short upper midline incision. The gastrojejunostomy was made by means of a circular stapler and the Roux limb placed behind the colon and excluded stomach. RESULTS: The postoperative outcome, with respect to morphine consumption, complications, hospital stay (6 days) and weight loss, was similar in the two groups. The operating time was significantly longer in the hand-assisted group (150 versus 85 min; P < 0.001) but there was no conversion to open operation. One patient in the hand-assisted group was reoperated owing to leakage and one patient developed an incisional hernia after open RYGBP. CONCLUSION: The hand-assisted technique was feasible and allowed good working conditions in all patients. However, the postoperative outcome was excellent in both groups and there was no advantage to the hand-assisted technique. <EV> <t> Laparoscopic vertical banded gastroplasty and laparoscopic gastric bypass: a comparison. <abs> BACKGROUND: Vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and gastric bypass (GBP) are the two bariatric procedures recommended by NIH consensus conference. Recent advancement in laparoscopic (L) techniques has made LVBG and LGBP alternatives for the conventional open approach. METHODS: From December 2000 to February 2002, 80 patients (24 men and 56 women; mean age 32 years, range 18-57) with morbid obesity (mean BMI 43.2 kg/m(2), range 36-59.8) were enrolled in a prospective trial and randomly assigned to LVBG or LGBP. Changes in quality of life were assessed using the Gastro-intestinal quality of life index (GIQLI). RESULTS: The conversion rate was zero for LVBG and 2.5% (1/40) for LGBP. There has been no mortality. Surgical time was significantly longer for LGBP (209 minvs 126 min for LVBG, P<0.001). Mean hospital stay was 3.5 days for the LVBG vs 5.7 days for LGBP (P<0.001). Postoperative analgesic usage was also less for LVBG patients (mean dose 1.4 vs 2.4, P<0.05). Early complication rate was higher in the LGBP group (17.8% vs 2.5%, P<0.001). All 3 major complications were in the LGBP group, of which 2 were related to anastomotic leakage (5%). Late complications consisted of upper GI bleeding, stenosis and others observed in 4 LGBP patients (10%) and 2 LVBG patients (5%). Mean follow-up was 20 months (range 18 to 30). BMI fell significantly in both groups, with significant improvement of obesity-related co-morbidities. LGBP had significantly better excess weight loss than LVBG (62.9% vs 55.4% at 1 year and 71.4% vs 53.1% at 2 years), as well as lower BMI than LVBG (29.6 vs 31.1 at 1 year and 28.5 vs 31.9 at 2 years). There was no difference in the reduction of obesity-related laboratory abnormalities at 1 year except a lower hemoglobin in LGBP (11.8 vs 13.8, P<0.05). Preoperative GIQLI scores were similar between the groups; however, at 1 year, LGBP patients had better GIOLI scores than LVBG patients (121 vs 106, P<0.01). LVBG had improvement in physical condition, social function and emotional conditioning but deterioration in GI symptoms which resulted in no increase in total GIQLI score. CONCLUSION: LGBP was a time-consuming demanding technique with a higher early complication rate compared with LVBG. Although both operations resulted in significant weight reduction and decrease in obesity-related co-morbidities, LGBP had a trend of greater weight loss and significantly better GIQLI than LVBG at the cost of a significant long-term trace element deficiency state. Each patient should be individualized for the operations according to the patient's decision. <EV> <t> Laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding versus vertical banded gastroplasty in morbidly obese patients: a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To compare, in a prospective, randomized, single-institution trial laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding (LASGB) with laparoscopic vertical banded gastroplasty (LVBG) in morbidly obese patients. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: LASGB is a simple and safe procedure, but some reports have suggested disappointing long-term results. Despite the recent widespread use of LASGB, there are no prospective nor randomized trials comparing LASGB with other laparoscopic procedures. METHODS: A total of 100 morbidly obese patients, with body mass index (BMI) 40 to 50 kg/m2, without compulsive eating, were randomized to either LASGB (n = 49) or LVBG (n = 51). Minimum follow-up was 2 years (mean 33.1 months). RESULTS: There were no deaths or conversions in either group. Mean operative time was 94.2 minutes in LVBGs and 65.4 in LASGBs (P < 0.05). Early morbidity rate was lower in LASGBs (6.1%) versus LVBGs (9.8%) (P = 0.754). Mean hospital stay was shorter in LASGBs versus LVBGs: 3.7 days versus 6.6 (P < 0.05). Late complications rate in LVBGs was 14% (7 of 50) and in LASGBs 32.7% (16 of 49) (P < 0.05). The most frequent complication was the slippage of the band (18%). Late reoperations rate in LVBGs was 0% (0 of 50) versus 24.5% (12 of 49) in LASGBs (P < 0.001). Excess weight loss in LVBGs was, at 2 years, 63.5% and, at 3 years, 58.9%; in LASGBs, excess weight loss, respectively, was 41.4% and 39%. BMI in LVBGs was, at 2 years, 29.7 kg/m2 and, at 3 years, 30.7 kg/m2; in LASGBs, BMI was 34.8 kg/m2 at 2 years and 35.7 kg/m2 at 3 years. According to Reinhold's classification, a residual excess weight <50% was achieved, at 2 years, in 74% of LVBG and 35% of LASGB (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that, in patients with BMI 40 to 50 kg/m2, LASGB requires shorter operative time and hospital stay but LVBG is more effective in terms of late complications, reoperations, and weight loss.", "summary:reference": "The limited evidence suggests that surgery is more effective than conventional management for weight loss in morbid obesity.

LVBG and LGBB are less effective than open gastric bypass, but this is not a clinically important finding. LVB is more successful in reducing the weight loss of morbidly obese patients, but not in the reduction of morbidity or morbidity. LVGBP is not as effective as LVBG in reducing morbidity, but it is a more effective technique for weight reduction and weight loss compared with LVBG, and it is more cost effective. LVBBG and LVGB are more cost-effective than LVBG or LVBG for weight-loss and morbidity reduction, but they are not as cost-effectively effective as VBG or LGBG.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Nicotine inhaler and nicotine patch as a combination therapy for smoking cessation: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Nicotine replacement therapy is an effective treatment for nicotine-dependent smokers. However, cessation rates are modest, and preliminary studies suggest that combination therapy may be superior. We compared the efficacy of the nicotine inhaler plus nicotine patch vs nicotine inhaler plus placebo patch for smoking cessation. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 400 subjects who had smoked 10 or more cigarettes per day for 3 years or longer. Group 1 (n = 200) received the nicotine inhaler plus nicotine patch (delivering 15 mg of nicotine per 16 hours) for 6 weeks, then inhaler plus placebo patch for 6 weeks, then inhaler alone for 14 weeks. Group 2 (n = 200) received the nicotine inhaler plus placebo patch for 12 weeks, then inhaler for 14 weeks. Inhaler was used at a rate of 6 to 12 cartridges per day ad libitum for 3 months and then tapered off. Main outcome measures were complete abstinence (self-reported) and expired carbon dioxide concentration less than 10 ppm. RESULTS: Group 1 vs group 2 complete abstinence rates were 60.5% and 47.5% at 6 weeks (P =.009), 42.0% and 31.0% at 12 weeks (P =.02), 25.0% and 22.5% at 6 months (P =.56), and 19.5% and 14.0% at 12 months (P =. 14). One-year survival analysis showed a significant association between abstinence and treatment with nicotine inhaler plus nicotine patch (P =.04). Mean nicotine substitution at week 6 was 60.1% (group 1) and 24.6% (group 2) (P<.001). At 12 months, the frequency of respiratory symptoms in abstinent subjects fell significantly and lung function showed a trend toward improvement. The most common adverse events were throat irritation (inhaler) and itching (patch). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the nicotine inhaler plus nicotine patch resulted in significantly higher cessation rates than inhaler plus placebo patch. <EV> <t> Nicotine patches for pregnant smokers: a randomized controlled study. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of nicotine patches on continine-validated smoking cessation in pregnant women and the effect of nicotine on birth weight and preterm delivery. METHODS: Pregnant women who smoked ten or more cigarettes after the first trimester (N = 250) were randomly assigned to receive nicotine patches (n = 124) or placebo patches (n = 126). Women randomized to nicotine were treated with 15-mg patches (16 hours/day) for 8 weeks, and 10-mg patches (16 hours/day) for 3 weeks. RESULTS: Overall, 26% stopped smoking and 14% were nonsmokers 1 year after delivery. There was no difference between nicotine and placebo groups. At the end of the intervention, the mean value of cotinine in saliva in women assigned to nicotine was 120 ng/mL and placebo 153 ng/mL (mean difference -33; 95% CI -72, 6 ng/mL). Mean birth weight difference was 186 g (95% CI 35, 336 g) higher in the nicotine than placebo group, and there was an insignificantly lower rate of low birth weight (under 2500 g) in the former group. There was no difference in the rate of preterm delivery between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Nicotine patches had no influence on smoking cessation during pregnancy, although they might increase birth weight in comparison with placebo. <EV> <t> Smoking cessation with four nicotine replacement regimes in a lung clinic. <abs> Smoking cessation is a key intervention for prevention of several lung diseases. The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of smoking cessation with nicotine replacement in a lung clinic in a low resource set-up suitable for implementation in other lung clinics. This was an open, randomized trial with 4 different nicotine replacement regimes combined with minimal behavioural support in daily routine. A total of 446 smokers (>9 cigarettes x day(-1)) were allocated to a nurse-conducted smoking cessation programme with 4 treatment arms: a 5-mg nicotine patch (\"placebo\"), a 15-mg nicotine patch, nicotine inhaler, and a 15-mg nicotine patch plus nicotine inhaler. Recommended use of the nicotine products were 3 months with the possibility of continuing use up to 9 months on an individual basis. Individual follow-up studies were scheduled after 2 and 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The 12-month point prevalence was 6% (5-mg patch (placebo)), 16% (15-mg patch) (p<0.05), 9% (inhaler) and 11% (15-mg patch plus inhaler), respectively. To conclude, the set-up investigated in this study which included minimal behavioural support with nicotine patches should be evaluated in other lung clinics, as it doubled success rate when compared to a placebo with a 1-yr point prevalence of 16% and also the resources used are limited. <EV> <t> A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical evaluation of a nicotine sublingual tablet in smoking cessation. <abs> AIMS: Evaluation of the clinical efficacy and safety of a nicotine 2-mg sublingual tablet in smoking cessation. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of smokers using the 2-mg tablet for 3-6 months with follow-up to 12 months. Dosing was established according to baseline nicotine dependence, scored on the Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire (FTQ): FTQ > or = 7, two tablets/hour (maximum 40/day); FTQ < 7, one tablet/hour (maximum 20/day). SETTING: Smoking cessation programme in a department of oral and maxillofacial surgery. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 247 adult smokers, smoking > or = 10 cigarettes/day for > or = 3 years, of whom 123 received active and 124 placebo treatment. The study was powered to detect difference at 6 months. MEASUREMENTS: Efficacy and safety were evaluated at 6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months. Self-reported abstinence was verified by exhaled CO < 10 p.p.m. FINDINGS: Success rates for complete abstinence (no slips after 2 weeks) for active vs. placebo were 50% vs. 29% at 6 weeks, 42% vs. 23% at 3 months, 33% vs. 18% at 6 months and 23% vs. 15% at 12 months (p < 0.001, 0.001, 0.005 and p = 0.14), respectively. Craving during the first 8 days was significantly reduced among highly dependent smokers on active treatment compared to placebo. Baseline mucosal lesions among abstinent subjects were reduced during the treatment period and at the non-treatment follow-up. Adverse events were mild and tolerable, the most common being irritation and soreness in the mouth and throat. CONCLUSION: The nicotine sublingual tablet increased the smoking cessation rate compared to placebo, reduced craving in highly dependent smokers and was well tolerated. <EV> <t> Smoking reduction with oral nicotine inhalers: double blind, randomised clinical trial of efficacy and safety. <abs> OBJECTIVES: To determine whether use of an oral nicotine inhaler can result in long term reduction in smoking and whether concomitant use of nicotine replacement and smoking is safe. DESIGN: Double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial. Four month trial with a two year follow up. SETTING: Two university hospital pulmonary clinics in Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: 400 healthy volunteers, recruited through newspaper advertisements, willing to reduce their smoking but unable or unwilling to stop smoking immediately. INTERVENTION: Active or placebo inhaler as needed for up to 18 months, with participants encouraged to limit their smoking as much as possible. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of cigarettes smoked per day from week six to end point. Decrease verified by a measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide at each time point compared with measurement at baseline. RESULTS: At four months sustained reduction of smoking was achieved in 52 (26%) participants in the active group and 18 (9%) in the placebo group (P<0.001; Fisher's test). Corresponding figures after two years were 19 (9.5%) and 6 (3.0%) (P=0.012). CONCLUSION: Nicotine inhalers effectively and safely achieved sustained reduction in smoking over 24 months. Reduction with or without nicotine substitution may be a feasible first step towards smoking cessation in people not able or not willing to stop abruptly. <EV> <t> Effects of nicotine gum dose by level of nicotine dependence. <abs> We used the Heaviness of Smoking Index, a subset of the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, to classify 608 cigarette smokers planning a cessation attempt as low or high in nicotine dependence. Subjects within each level of dependence were then randomly assigned to placebo, 2-mg, or 4-mg nicotine gum treatment. Subjects were also provided brief (5-10 min per visit) behavioral counseling during a 1-year period of follow-up. At 1 year post-cessation, quit rates were 11.2, 19.5, and 18.4% for low-dependence smokers receiving placebo, 2-mg, and 4-mg gum, respectively (plinear trend = 0.20). For high-dependence smokers, quit rates at 1 year were 6.1, 15.7, and 20.7% for the placebo, 2-mg, and 4-mg gum conditions, respectively (plinear trend = 0.002). The interaction of nicotine-gum dose and dependence group was not significant (p = 0.42), nor did the 2-mg and 4-mg doses differ significantly in effectiveness, though both 2-mg and 4-mg gum were significantly more effective than placebo gum. We also found a significant dose-related effect for nicotine gum to moderate post-cessation heart-rate decline. Other variables related to abstinence at 1 year post-cessation were a longer period of abstinence on a prior quit attempt, being married, higher education level, and having a non-smoking spouse or significant other. Results indicate that nicotine gum is a significant aid to smoking cessation, more than doubling the odds of successful cessation compared to the odds for placebo-gum users. The 4-mg dose provided a non-significant increase in cessation rates for high-dependence smokers.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Txt2stop: a pilot randomised controlled trial of mobile phone-based smoking cessation support. <abs> AIM: To conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial of mobile phone-based smoking cessation support intervention for the UK population. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial (txt2stop). SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: 200 participants responding to radio, poster and leaflet-based promotions regarding the trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The response rate for the outcome measures planned for the main trial. Participants' qualitative responses to open-ended questions about the intervention content. Secondary outcomes were the outcomes planned for the main trial including the point prevalence of self-reported smoking at 4 weeks and pooled effect estimate for the short-term results for the STOMP and txt2stop trials. RESULTS: The response rate at 4 weeks was 96% and at 6 months was 92%. The results at 4 weeks show a doubling of self-reported quitting relative risk (RR) 2.08 (95% CI 1.11 to 3.89), 26% vs 12%. The pooled effect estimate combining txt2stop and a previous New Zealand trial in the short term is RR 2.18 (95% CI 1.79 to 2.65). CONCLUSIONS: Mobile phone-based smoking cessation is an innovative means of delivering smoking cessation support, which doubles the self-reported quit rate in the short term. It could represent an important, but as yet largely unused, medium to deliver age-appropriate public health measures. The long-term effect of this mobile phone-based smoking cessation support will be established by a large randomised controlled trial currently in recruitment. <EV> <t> A theory-based video messaging mobile phone intervention for smoking cessation: randomized controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Advances in technology allowed the development of a novel smoking cessation program delivered by video messages sent to mobile phones. This social cognitive theory-based intervention (called \"STUB IT\") used observational learning via short video diary messages from role models going through the quitting process to teach behavioral change techniques. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess the effectiveness of a multimedia mobile phone intervention for smoking cessation. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 6-month follow-up. Participants had to be 16 years of age or over, be current daily smokers, be ready to quit, and have a video message-capable phone. Recruitment targeted younger adults predominantly through radio and online advertising. Registration and data collection were completed online, prompted by text messages. The intervention group received an automated package of video and text messages over 6 months that was tailored to self-selected quit date, role model, and timing of messages. Extra messages were available on demand to beat cravings and address lapses. The control group also set a quit date and received a general health video message sent to their phone every 2 weeks. RESULTS: The target sample size was not achieved due to difficulty recruiting young adult quitters. Of the 226 randomized participants, 47% (107/226) were female and 24% (54/226) were Maori (indigenous population of New Zealand). Their mean age was 27 years (SD 8.7), and there was a high level of nicotine addiction. Continuous abstinence at 6 months was 26.4% (29/110) in the intervention group and 27.6% (32/116) in the control group (P = .8). Feedback from participants indicated that the support provided by the video role models was important and appreciated. CONCLUSIONS: This study was not able to demonstrate a statistically significant effect of the complex video messaging mobile phone intervention compared with simple general health video messages via mobile phone. However, there was sufficient positive feedback about the ease of use of this novel intervention, and the support obtained by observing the role model video messages, to warrant further investigation.

We assessed the effect of an automated smoking cessation programme delivered via mobile phone text messaging on continuous abstinence, which was biochemically verified at 6 months. METHODS: In this single-blind, randomised trial, undertaken in the UK, smokers willing to make a quit attempt were randomly allocated, using an independent telephone randomisation system, to a mobile phone text messaging smoking cessation programme (txt2stop), comprising motivational messages and behavioural-change support, or to a control group that received text messages unrelated to quitting. The system automatically generated intervention or control group texts according to the allocation. Outcome assessors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was self-reported continuous smoking abstinence, biochemically verified at 6 months. All analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN 80978588. FINDINGS: We assessed 11,914 participants for eligibility. 5800 participants were randomised, of whom 2915 smokers were allocated to the txt2stop intervention and 2885 were allocated to the control group; eight were excluded because they were randomised more than once. Primary outcome data were available for 5524 (95%) participants. Biochemically verified continuous abstinence at 6 months was significantly increased in the txt2stop group (10.7% txt2stop vs 4.9% control, relative risk [RR] 2.20, 95% CI 1.80-2.68; p<0.0001). Similar results were obtained when participants that were lost to follow-up were treated as smokers (268 [9%] of 2911 txt2stop vs 124 [4%] of 2881 control [RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.74-2.63; p<0.0001]), and when they were excluded (268 [10%] of 2735 txt2stop vs 124 [4%] of 2789 control [2.20, 1.79-2.71; p<0.0001]). No significant heterogeneity was shown in any of the prespecified subgroups. INTERPRETATION: The txt2stop smoking cessation programme significantly improved smoking cessation rates at 6 months and should be considered for inclusion in smoking cessation services.

{"document": "<EV> <t> A randomized, controlled study comparing the cosmetic outcome of a new wound closure device with Prolene suture closing caesarean wounds. <abs> A prospective, randomised study was conducted to compare the wound closure performance and cosmetic outcome of caesarean section wounds closed with traditional Prolene suture or a new wound closure device (Leukosan((R)) SkinLink). Sixty-one patients referred to primary section were allocated to wound closure with either Leukosan((R)) SkinLink or Prolene suture. Cosmetic outcome as the primary measure was evaluated by the patient, the surgeon as well as by independent examiners blinded to the method of wound closure. Evaluations were recorded at 3, 6 and 12 months following wound closure. Both methods of wound closure scored equally high on the visual analogue scale for cosmetic evaluation at the 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups as assessed by the patient, surgeon and the blinded observers. The study has shown that innovative methods for wound closure compared with traditional methods such as suture providing excellent cosmetic results represent a valid alternative to physician and patient for surgical incisions. <EV> <t> Scar appearance of different skin and subcutaneous tissue closure techniques in caesarean section: a randomized study. <abs> OBJECTIVES: To determine the role of skin and subcutaneous space closure in caesarean section on the cosmetic appearance of the scar and the patients' satisfaction. STUDY DESIGN: 153 patients undergoing caesarean section without prior abdominal delivery were included and randomly assigned in a non-blinded study to four different combinations of skin and subcutaneous tissue closure. The scar was assessed after a period of at least 4 months by a self-developed protocol and the patient was asked to complete a survey regarding her satisfaction with the scar. RESULTS: One hundred patients were eligible for long-term evaluation of the scar. Skin closure by either staples or intracutaneous suture in combination with closure or non-closure of the subcutaneous space has a comparable outcome in view of cosmetic outcome and patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: All four methods of skin closure seem to be a reasonable choice in caesarean section because they have comparable cosmetic outcome, do not differ with respect to the patients' satisfaction and bear comparable costs. <EV> <t> Cosmetic outcomes of various skin closure methods following cesarean delivery: a randomized trial. <abs> OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to compare scar quality associated with different types of wound closure methods after cesarean section (CS). STUDY DESIGN: Patients were randomized to have skin closure following CS with either staples or 3 different types of subcuticular sutures. Scar quality was evaluated 2 and 6 months postoperatively. The Vancouver Scar Scale, the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), and a visual analog scale were used as scar assessment tools. RESULTS: Of the 180 patients who were recruited, 123 successfully completed the study. No difference in both subjective and objective scar rating was detected across groups at either 2 months or 6 months. In the overall study population, objective scores correlated with patient rating, and correlation was strongest between the observer and patient components of the POSAS (r = 0.48). CONCLUSION: In women undergoing CS, stapled wounds and those closed with subcuticular sutures result in equivalent cosmetic appearance of the scar. <EV> <t> Absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures for subcuticular skin closure of a transverse suprapubic incision. <EV> <t> A randomized study comparing skin closure in cesarean sections: staples vs subcuticular sutures. <abs> OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare postoperative pain according to the skin closure method (subcuticular sutures vs staples) after an elective term cesarean section. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial of 101 women was performed. Women were randomly assigned to subcuticular sutures or staples. Operative technique and postoperative analgesia were standardized. Stratification was used for primary vs repeat cesareans. Analog pain and satisfaction scales ranging from 0-10 were completed at postoperative days 1 and 3, and at 6 weeks postoperatively. A digital photograph of the incision was taken at 6 weeks postoperatively and evaluated by 3 independent blinded observers. RESULTS: Pain at 6 weeks postoperatively was significantly less in the staple group (0.17 vs 0.51; P = .04). Operative time was shorter in that group (24.6 vs 32.9 minutes; P < .0001). No difference was noted for incision appearance and women's satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Staples are the method of choice for skin closure for elective term cesareans in our population. <EV> <t> Randomized controlled trial of wound complication rates of subcuticular suture vs staples for skin closure at cesarean delivery. <abs> OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the wound complication rates and patient satisfaction for subcuticular suture vs staples for skin closure at cesarean delivery. STUDY DESIGN: This was a randomized prospective trial. Subjects who underwent cesarean delivery were assigned randomly to stainless steel staples or subcuticular 4.0 Monocryl sutures. The primary outcomes were composite wound complication rate and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 435 patients were assigned randomly. Staple closure was associated with a 4-fold increased risk of wound separation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.07-10.52; P < .001). Having a wound complication was associated with a 5-fold decrease in patient satisfaction (aOR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.09-0.37; P < .001). After confounders were controlled for, there was no difference in satisfaction between the treatment groups (aOR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.34-1.50; P = .63). CONCLUSION: Use of staples for cesarean delivery closure is associated with an increased risk of wound complications. Occurrence of a wound complication is the most important factor that influenced patient satisfaction. <EV> <t> Evaluation of a novel technique for wound closure using a barbed suture. <abs> BACKGROUND: Suture knots present several disadvantages in wound closure, because they are tedious to tie and place ischemic demands on tissue. Bulky knots may be a nidus for infection, and they may extrude through skin weeks after surgery. Needle manipulations during knot-tying predispose the surgeon to glove perforation. A barbed suture was developed that is self-anchoring, requiring no knots or slack management for wound closure. The elimination of knot tying may have advantages over conventional wound closure methods. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, controlled trial was designed to show that the use of barbed suture in dermal closure of the Pfannenstiel incision during nonemergent cesarean delivery surgery produces scar cosmesis at 5 weeks that is no worse than that observed with conventional closure using 3-0 polydioxanone suture. Cosmesis was assessed by review of postoperative photographs by a blinded, independent plastic surgeon using the modified Hollander cosmesis score. Secondary endpoints included infection, dehiscence, pain, closure time, and other adverse events. RESULTS: The study enrolled 195 patients, of whom 188 were eligible for analysis. Cosmesis scores did not significantly differ between the barbed suture group and the control group. Rates of infection, dehiscence, and other adverse events did not significantly differ between the two groups. Closure time and pain scores were comparable between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The barbed suture represents an innovative option for wound closure. With a cosmesis and safety profile that is similar to that of conventional suture technique, it avoids the drawbacks inherent to suture knots.", "summary:reference": "There is currently no conclusive evidence about how the skin should be closed after caesarean section.

Citicoline is thought to have neuroprotective benefits and has been used for the treatment of chronic cerebrovascular disorders, though its effectiveness has not been fully tested. This randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted to determine whether daily citicoline treatment improves neurocognitive and neuroimaging outcome over 12 months among patients diagnosed with vascular dementia (VaD).

Patients were assessed at baseline, and at 6, and 12 months on a battery of neurocognitive tests. Neuroimaging measures of total brain volume and subcortical/periventricular hyperintensity (SH) volume on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were collected at baseline and the 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: The citicoline and placebo treatment groups did not differ in their neuropsychological performance at baseline and the 12-month follow-up.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Effects of epidural lidocaine analgesia on labor and delivery: a randomized, prospective, controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Whether epidural analgesia for labor prolongs the active-first and second labor stages and increases the risk of vacuum-assisted delivery is a controversial topic. Our study was conducted to answer the question: does lumbar epidural analgesia with lidocaine affect the progress of labor in our obstetric population? METHOD: 395 healthy, nulliparous women, at term, presented in spontaneous labor with a singleton vertex presentation. These patients were randomized to receive analgesia either, epidural with bolus doses of 1% lidocaine or intravenous, with meperidine 25 to 50 mg when their cervix was dilated to 4 centimeters. The duration of the active-first and second stages of labor and the neonatal apgar scores were recorded, in each patient. The total number of vacuum-assisted and cesarean deliveries were also measured. RESULTS: 197 women were randomized to the epidural group. 198 women were randomized to the single-dose intravenous meperidine group. There was no statistical difference in rates of vacuum-assisted delivery rate. Cesarean deliveries, as a consequence of fetal bradycardia or dystocia, did not differ significantly between the groups. Differences in the duration of the active-first and the second stages of labor were not statistically significant. The number of newborns with 1-min and 5-min Apgar scores less than 7, did not differ significantly between both analgesia groups. CONCLUSION: Epidural analgesia with 1% lidocaine does not prolong the active-first and second stages of labor and does not increase vacuum-assisted or cesarean delivery rate. <EV> <t> [Transient neurological symptoms in puerperas after epidural analgesia during labor]. <abs> The investigation was undertaken to elucidate the impact of epidural analgesia (EA) during labor on the incidence of transient neurological symptoms (TNS). By the agreement of a local ethics committee, an informed consent was obtained from 90 healthy puerperas enrolled in the investigation. The patients were randomized into 3 groups, with 30 patients in each. At the beginning of labor, an epidural catheter was inserted in all the puerperas. For EA, 1% lidocaine solution and 0.2% ropivacaine solution were used in Groups 1 and 2, respectively; Group 3 was control in which EA was not performed. Two days after labor, an independent observer asked the females about possible neurological symptoms, by using the standard questionnaire. TNS included symmetric pain and/or dysesthesia in the buttocks, lower lumbar region, and/or legs. The patients who presented problems were proposed to indicate the degree of discomfort by a 10-score verbal scale. The findings were statistically processed using the U-test and X-test (p < 0. 05). A total of TNS occurred in 22 (25%) patients, including 7 (27%), 8 (27%), and 7 (23%) in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant. The duration of TNS was generally short; in all the patients, the symptoms were completely resolved after 24-72 hours. Labor EA is not a cause of TNS. The type of a local anesthetic (lidocaine, ropivacaine) does not affect the incidence of TNS in puerperas after labor EA. <EV> <t> The effects of remifentanil or acetaminophen with epidural ropivacaine on body temperature during labor. <abs> PURPOSE: Epidural analgesia is associated with hyperthermia during labor and presumably causes it, although no convincing mechanism has been postulated. It seems likely that fever associated with pyrogenic factors related to labor is suppressed by opioids, whereas it is expressed normally in patients given epidural analgesia. We examined this hypothesis and the possible etiology of temperature elevation in labor. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, controlled study, we assessed 201 parturients during spontaneous labor. Analgesia was randomly provided with one of four treatment groups: (1) epidural ropivacaine alone, (2) IV remifentanil alone, (3) epidural ropivacaine plus IV remifentanil, and (4) epidural ropivacaine plus IV acetaminophen. At randomization, patients were normothermic. Intrapartum hyperthermia (>or=38 degrees C) was correlated to the analgesic technique. RESULTS: The maximum increase in oral temperature was greatest in the ropivacaine group (0.7 +/- 0.6 degrees C) and least in the remifentanil group (0.3 +/- 0.4 degrees C; P = 0.013). The percentage of patients who became hyperthermic (>or=38 degrees C) during the first 6 h of labor was greatest in the ropivacaine group (14%) and least in the remifentanil-alone group (2%), but the difference was not statistically significant. The maximum forearm-finger gradients were lower (less vasoconstriction) in the remifentanil group when compared to the gradients in patients with epidural analgesia (1.4 +/- 1.8 vs 3.0 +/- 1.7, respectively; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with the theory that low-dose opioids inhibit fever in patients not given epidural analgesia. However, in view of the negative results, the hypothesis of epidural-induced hyperthermia may be questionable. <EV> <t> Intravenous remifentanil vs. epidural levobupivacaine with fentanyl for pain relief in early labour: a randomised, controlled, double-blinded study. <abs> BACKGROUND: We hypothesised that intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA) with remifentanil could provide as satisfactory pain relief for labour as epidural analgesia. METHODS: Fifty-two parturients with singleton uncomplicated pregnancies were randomised to receive either IV PCA with remifentanil or epidural analgesia with 20 ml levobupivacaine 0.625 mg/ml and fentanyl 2 microg/ml in saline. The PCA dose of remifentanil was given over 1 min with a lockout time of 1 min. The dose was increased starting from the bolus of 0.1 microg/kg and following a dose escalation scheme up until the individual-effective dose was reached. The parturients assessed contraction pain (0-10), pain relief (0-4), sedation and nausea during 60 min. RESULTS: Forty-five parturients were included in the analysis. The median cervical opening was 4 cm before the study and 7 cm after the study. The median pain scores were 7.3 and 5.2 during remifentanil and epidural analgesia, respectively (P=0.009). The median pain relief scores were 2.5 and 2.8 (P=0.17). There was no difference between the groups in the proportion of parturients who discontinued due to ineffective analgesia, nor in the proportion of parturients who would have liked to continue the given medication at the end of the study. Sedation and low haemoglobin oxygen saturation were observed more often during remifentanil analgesia. Foetal heart rate tracing abnormalities were as common in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of pain scores, epidural analgesia is superior to that provided by IV remifentanil. However, there was no difference in the pain relief scores between the treatments. <EV> <t> Labor analgesia in preeclampsia: remifentanil patient controlled intravenous analgesia versus epidural analgesia. <abs> BACKGROUND: Epidural analgesia is considered to be the preferred method of labor analgesia in preeclamptic patients. Systemic opioids are another good effective, easy to administer alternative but may cause maternal and fetal respiratory depression. Remifentanil's rapid onset and offset of effects, should make it an ideal drug for the intermittent painful contraction during labor. Method. 30 preeclamptic patients were randomly assigned to one of two equal groups; Epidural Group: received epidural analgesia according to a standardized protocol using bupivacaine plus fentanyl. REMIFENTANIL GROUP: PCA was set up to deliver remlfentanil 0.5 microg/kg as a loading bolus infused over 20 seconds, lockout time of 5 minutes, PCA bolus of 0.25 microg/kg, continuous background infusion of 0.05 microg/kg/min, and maximum dose is 3 mg in 4 hours. Women were advised to start the PCA bolus when they feel the signs of a coming uterine contraction. RESULTS: All women demonstrated a significant decrease in VAS score in the first hour after administration of analgesia (P < 0.05).

{"document": "<EV> <t> Pentobarbital versus thiopental in the treatment of refractory intracranial hypertension in patients with traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial. <abs> INTRODUCTION: Experimental research has demonstrated that the level of neuroprotection conferred by the various barbiturates is not equal. Until now no controlled studies have been conducted to compare their effectiveness, even though the Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines recommend that such studies be undertaken. The objectives of the present study were to assess the effectiveness of pentobarbital and thiopental in terms of controlling refractory intracranial hypertension in patients with severe traumatic brain injury, and to evaluate the adverse effects of treatment. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, cohort study comparing two treatments: pentobarbital and thiopental. Patients who had suffered a severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score after resuscitation < or = 8 points or neurological deterioration during the first week after trauma) and with refractory intracranial hypertension (intracranial pressure > 20 mmHg) first-tier measures, in accordance with the Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients (22 in each group) were included over a 5-year period. There were no statistically significant differences in ' baseline characteristics, except for admission computed cranial tomography characteristics, using the Traumatic Coma Data Bank classification. Uncontrollable intracranial pressure occurred in 11 patients (50%) in the thiopental treatment group and in 18 patients (82%) in the pentobarbital group (P = 0.03). Under logistic regression analysis--undertaken in an effort to adjust for the cranial tomography characteristics, which were unfavourable for pentobarbital--thiopental was more effective than pentobarbital in terms of controlling intracranial pressure (odds ratio = 5.1, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 21.9; P = 0.027). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to the incidence of arterial hypotension or infection. CONCLUSIONS: Thiopental appeared to be more effective than pentobarbital in controlling intracranial hypertension refractory to first-tier measures. These findings should be interpreted with caution because of the imbalance in cranial tomography characteristics and the different dosages employed in the two arms of the study.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Carotid endarterectomy with a polyurethane patch versus primary closure: a prospective randomized study. <abs> INTRODUCTION: The use of synthetic patch angioplasty during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been advocated to reduce restenosis, stroke, and death, but the type of material used is still being debated. This study compared rate of restenosis, neurologic events, and perioperative death in patients undergoing CEA with primary closure versus polyester urethane patch closure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective randomized study, we compared patch angioplasty with polyester urethane (Vascular-patch, B. Braun Medical AG, Tuttlingen, Germany) to primary closure between February 1999 and March 2002 in 404 operations. Early (30-day) stroke and mortality rate, long-term restenosis, and neurologic events were compared in the two groups during 2.5 to 5 years of follow-up (median follow-up, 2 years). RESULTS: Primary closure was used in 216 operations, and patch angioplasty was used in 206. Clamping time was significantly shorter in the primary closure group ( P < .001). Perioperative mortality and neurologic events were similar in both groups (1.9% vs 3.9%, P = .21, odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 9.85). The rate of residual stenosis (> or =50%) at 0 or 3-month follow-up was significantly lower in the patch group (2 operations, 1.1%) compared with the primary closure group (17 operations, 8.9%) ( P = .001, OR, 0.114; 95% CI, 0.026 to 0.5). Multivariable logistic regression showed that only primacy closure was found to influence residual stenosis. Restenosis of 70% was significantly less in the patch angioplasty group (2.2% vs 8.6%) ( P = . 01, hazard ratio, 0.246; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.75). No correlation was found between restenosis and gender, preoperative symptoms, or risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Patch angioplasty with polyester urethane significantly reduced the restenosis rate ( P = . 01) compared with primary closure.

METHODS: Three hundred thirty-eight elective carotid endarterectomies in 315 patients were randomized to direct arteriotomy or closure with a polyester collagen-coated vascular patch. Ten procedures did not follow the randomization process because of technical difficulties and were excluded. Vessel patency (duplex ultrasound) and outcome were assessed during and immediately after surgery and at 4 and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS: Four-month ultrasound assessment (n = 321) identified five occluded vessels: two in the patch group (n = 149) and three in the direct closure group (n = 172). Six patients in the patch group had died or were significantly disabled at 4 months, compared with five in the direct closure group. At the 12-month assessment (n = 313), eight vessels had occluded: five from the patched group (n = 146) and three from the direct closure group (n = 167). Eight patients in the patch group had died or were significantly disabled, compared with four in the direct closure group. No statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of vessel occlusion, morbidity, or mortality was seen (P > 0.1).

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 92 stable neonates 750-1250 g and gestational age <32 weeks were randomly allocated to enteral feeding advancement of 20 mL/kg/d (n = 46) or 30 mL/kg/d (n = 46). The primary outcome was days to reach full enteral feeding, defined as 180 mL/kg/d. Secondary outcomes included rates of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and culture-proven sepsis, days of parenteral nutrition (PN), length of hospital stay, and growth end points. RESULTS: Neonates in the rapid-feeding advancement group achieved full enteral volume of feedings earlier than the slower advancement group. They received significantly fewer days of PN, exhibited a shorter time to regain birth weight, and had a shorter duration of hospital stay. The incidence of NEC and the number of episodes of feeding intolerance were not significantly different between the groups, whereas the incidence of culture-proven late-onset sepsis was significantly less in infants receiving a rapid feeding advancement. Excluding infants who were small for gestational age at birth, the incidence of extrauterine growth restriction was significantly reduced in the rapid-advancement group at 28 days and at hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: Rapid enteral feeding advancements in 750-1250 g birth weight infants reduce the time to reach full enteral feeding and the use of PN administration.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Effect of exercise on the caloric intake of breast cancer patients undergoing treatment. <abs> The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an exercise intervention on the total caloric intake (TCI) of breast cancer patients undergoing treatment. A secondary purpose was to determine whether or not a relationship existed between changes in TCI, body fat composition (%BF), and fatigue during the study, which lasted 6 months. Twenty females recently diagnosed with breast cancer, scheduled to undergo chemotherapy or radiation, were assigned randomly to an experimental (N = 10) or control group (N = 10). Outcome measures included TCI (3-day food diary), %BF (skinfolds), and fatigue (revised Piper Fatigue Scale). Each exercise session was conducted as follows: initial cardiovascular activity (6-12 min), followed by stretching (5-10 min), resistance training (15-30 min), and a cool-down (approximately 8 min). Significant changes in TCI were observed among groups (F1,18 = 8.582; P = 0.009), at treatments 2 and 3, and at the end of the study [experimental (1973 +/- 419), control (1488 +/- 418); experimental (1946 +/- 437), control (1436 +/- 429); experimental (2315 +/- 455), control (1474 +/- 294), respectively]. A significant negative correlation was found (Spearman rho(18) = -0.759; P < 0.001) between TCI and %BF and between TCI and fatigue levels (Spearman rho(18) = -0.541; P = 0.014) at the end of the study. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that an exercise intervention administered to breast cancer patients undergoing medical treatment may assist in the mitigation of some treatment side effects, including decreased TCI, increased fatigue, and negative changes in body composition. <EV> <t> A randomized controlled trial of home-based exercise for cancer-related fatigue in women during and after chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. <abs> BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated an individualized home-based exercise prescription during and after cancer treatment. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based exercise training intervention, the Pro-self Fatigue Control Program on the management of cancer-related fatigue. INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: Participants (N = 119) were randomized into 1 of 3 groups: group 1 received the exercise prescription throughout the study; group 2 received their exercise prescription after completing cancer treatment; and group 3 received usual care. Patients completed the Piper Fatigue Scale, General Sleep Disturbance Scale, Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, and Worst Pain Intensity Scale. RESULTS: All groups reported mild fatigue levels, sleep disturbance, and mild pain, but not depression. Using multilevel regression analysis, significant linear and quadratic trends were found for change in fatigue and pain (ie, scores increased, then decreased over time). No group differences were found in the changing scores over time. A significant quadratic effect for the trajectory of sleep disturbance was found, but no group differences were detected over time. No significant time or group effects were found for depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our home-based exercise intervention had no effect on fatigue or related symptoms associated with cancer treatment. The optimal timing of exercise remains to be determined. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Clinicians need to be aware that some physical activity is better than none, and there is no harm in exercise as tolerated during cancer treatment. Further analysis is needed to examine the adherence to exercise. More frequent assessments of fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, and pain may capture the effect of exercise. <EV> <t> Cancer-related fatigue and rehabilitation: a randomized controlled multicenter trial comparing physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy with physical training only and with no intervention. <abs> BACKGROUND: Research suggests that cancer rehabilitation reduces fatigue in survivors of cancer. To date, it is unclear what type of rehabilitation is most beneficial. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial compared the effect on cancer-related fatigue of physical training combined with cognitive behavioral therapy with physical training alone and with no intervention. DESIGN: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, 147 survivors of cancer were randomly assigned to a group that received physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy (PT+CBT group, n=76) or to a group that received physical training alone (PT group, n=71). In addition, a nonintervention control group (WLC group) consisting of 62 survivors of cancer who were on the waiting lists of rehabilitation centers elsewhere was included. SETTING: The study was conducted at 4 rehabilitation centers in the Netherlands. PATIENTS: All patients were survivors of cancer. INTERVENTION: Physical training consisting of 2 hours of individual training and group sports took place twice weekly, and cognitive-behavioral therapy took place once weekly for 2 hours. MEASUREMENTS: Fatigue was assessed with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory before and immediately after intervention (12 weeks after enrollment). The WLC group completed questionnaires at the same time points. RESULTS: Baseline fatigue did not differ significantly among the 3 groups. Over time, levels of fatigue significantly decreased in all domains in all groups, except in mental fatigue in the WLC group. Analyses of variance of postintervention fatigue showed statistically significant group effects on general fatigue, on physical and mental fatigue, and on reduced activation but not on reduced motivation. Compared with the WLC group, the PT group reported significantly greater decline in 4 domains of fatigue, whereas the PT+CBT group reported significantly greater decline in physical fatigue only. No significant differences in decline in fatigue were found between the PT+CBT and PT groups. CONCLUSIONS: Physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy and physical training alone had significant and beneficial effects on fatigue compared with no intervention. Physical training was equally effective as or more effective than physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy in reducing cancer-related fatigue, suggesting that cognitive-behavioral therapy did not have additional beneficial effects beyond the benefits of physical training. <EV> <t> Effects of supervised exercise therapy in patients receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer. <abs> PURPOSE: Postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer has a number of associated complications. This study examined whether supervised moderate-intensity exercise could mitigate the complications that occur during radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty women were randomized before radiotherapy after various operations for breast cancer. Seventeen patients who were assigned to the exercise group performed supervised moderate-intensity exercise therapy for 50 min 3 times per week for 5 weeks. Twenty-three patients in the control group were asked to perform self-shoulder stretching exercise. The World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), brief fatigue inventory (BFI), range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder, and pain score were assessed before and after radiotherapy. RESULTS: There were no significant differences noted at baseline between groups. In the exercise group, there was an increase in the WHOQOL-BREF and shoulder ROM and decrease in BFI and pain score after radiotherapy. On the other hand, patients in the control group showed decrease in the WHOQOL-BREF and shoulder ROM and increase in BFI and pain score after radiotherapy. There were statistically significant differences in the changes in the WHOQOL, BFI, shoulder ROM, and pain score between the groups. CONCLUSION: Patients receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer may benefit in physical and psychological aspects from supervised moderate-intensity exercise therapy. <EV> <t> Effects of a walking intervention on fatigue-related experiences of hospitalized acute myelogenous leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy: a randomized controlled trial. <abs> The purpose of this randomized, controlled clinical trial was to preliminarily examine the effects of a three-week walking exercise program (WEP) on fatigue-related experiences of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients receiving chemotherapy. Eligible AML patients were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n=11), which received 12 minutes of WEP per day, five days per week for three consecutive weeks, or to a control group (n=11), which received standard ward care. Effects of the WEP were assessed by seven indicators: worst and average fatigue intensities, fatigue interference with patients' daily life, 12-minute walking distance, overall symptom distress, anxiety, and depressive status. All patients were evaluated four times: before chemotherapy (baseline or Day 1), Day 7, Day 14, and Day 21 of chemotherapy. Data were analyzed by Generalized Estimating Equation and revealed that AML patients in the three-week WEP group had a significantly greater increase in 12-minute walking distance than the control group. Patients in the WEP also had lower levels of fatigue intensity and interference, symptom distress, anxiety, and depressive status than the control group. Although preliminary, our results strongly suggest that three weeks of systematic walking exercise is clinically feasible for AML patients undergoing chemotherapy and can effectively improve their fatigue-related experiences. <EV> <t> Combined resistance and aerobic exercise program reverses muscle loss in men undergoing androgen suppression therapy for prostate cancer without bone metastases: a randomized controlled trial. <abs> PURPOSE: Androgen suppression therapy (AST) results in musculoskeletal toxicity that reduces physical function and quality of life. This study examined the impact of a combined resistance and aerobic exercise program as a countermeasure to these AST-related toxicities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2008, 57 patients with prostate cancer undergoing AST (commenced > 2 months prior) were randomly assigned to a program of resistance and aerobic exercise (n = 29) or usual care (n = 28) for 12 weeks. Primary end points were whole body and regional lean mass. Secondary end points were muscle strength and function, cardiorespiratory capacity, blood biomarkers, and quality of life. RESULTS: Analysis of covariance was used to compare outcomes for groups at 12 weeks adjusted for baseline values and potential confounders. Patients undergoing exercise showed an increase in lean mass compared with usual care (total body, P = .047; upper limb, P < .001; lower limb, P = .019) and similarly better muscle strength (P < .01), 6-meter walk time (P = .024), and 6-meter backward walk time (P = .039). Exercise also improved several aspects of quality of life including general health (P = .022) and reduced fatigue (P = .021) and decreased levels of C-reactive protein (P = .008). There were no adverse events during the testing or exercise intervention program. CONCLUSION: A relatively brief exposure to exercise significantly improved muscle mass, strength, physical function, and balance in hypogonadal men compared with normal care. The exercise regimen was well tolerated and could be recommended for patients undergoing AST as an effective countermeasure to these common treatment-related adverse effects. <EV> <t> Physical activity for men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: benefits from a 16-week intervention. <abs> GOALS OF WORK: Prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are vulnerable to a number of potentially debilitating side effects, which can significantly impact quality of life. The role of alternate therapies, such as physical activity (PA), in attenuating these side effects is largely understudied for such a large population. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of PA intervention for men receiving ADT on PA behavior, quality of life, and fitness measures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred participants were randomized into an intervention (n = 53) or a wait-list control group (n = 47), with 11 dropping out of the intervention group and 23 dropping out of the wait-list control group prior to post-testing. The intervention consisted of both an individually tailored home-based aerobic and light resistant training program and weekly group sessions. PA, quality of life, fitness, and physiological outcomes were assessed pre and post the 16-week intervention. RESULTS: Significant increases in PA, supported by changes in girth measures and blood pressure, support the beneficial impact of the intervention. Positive trends were also evident for depression and fatigue. However, due to the high dropout rate, these results must be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: PA effectively attenuates many of the side effects of ADT and should be recommended to prostate survivors as an alternate therapy. Determining the maintenance of this behavior change will be important for understanding how the long-term benefits of increased activity levels may alleviate the late effects of ADT. <EV> <t> Yoga of Awareness program for menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors: results from a randomized trial. <abs> GOAL OF WORK: Breast cancer survivors have limited options for the treatment of hot flashes and related symptoms. Further, therapies widely used to prevent recurrence in survivors, such as tamoxifen, tend to induce or exacerbate menopausal symptoms. The aim of this preliminary, randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effects of a yoga intervention on menopausal symptoms in a sample of survivors of early-stage breast cancer (stages IA-IIB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven disease-free women experiencing hot flashes were randomized to the 8-week Yoga of Awareness program (gentle yoga poses, meditation, and breathing exercises) or to wait-list control. The primary outcome was daily reports of hot flashes collected at baseline, posttreatment, and 3 months after treatment via an interactive telephone system. Data were analyzed by intention to treat. MAIN RESULTS: At posttreatment, women who received the yoga program showed significantly greater improvements relative to the control condition in hot-flash frequency, severity, and total scores and in levels of joint pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, symptom-related bother, and vigor. At 3 months follow-up, patients maintained their treatment gains in hot flashes, joint pain, fatigue, symptom-related bother, and vigor and showed additional significant gains in negative mood, relaxation, and acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study provides promising support for the beneficial effects of a comprehensive yoga program for hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms in early-stage breast cancer survivors. <EV> <t> A 4-week home-based aerobic and resistance exercise program during radiation therapy: a pilot randomized clinical trial. <abs> During radiation therapy, cancer patients may report cancer-related fatigue (CRF), which impairs aerobic capacity, strength, muscle mass, and, ultimately, quality of life (QOL). The purpose of this pilot clinical trial was to examine the feasibility and initial efficacy of a home-based aerobic and progressive resistance exercise intervention for aerobic capacity, strength, muscle mass, CRF, and QOL. Daily steps walked (DSW), daily minutes of resistance exercise (MRE), and number of resistance exercise days (RED) were assessed to evaluate intervention adherence. Breast and prostate cancer patients (n = 38) beginning radiation therapy were randomized to undergo 4 weeks of exercise or no exercise. Participants in the exercise group demonstrated good adherence to the exercise intervention, with significantly more DSW, MRE, and RED at post intervention and 3 month follow-up than controls. Participants in the exercise intervention exhibited significantly higher QOL and significantly lower CRF post intervention and at 3-month follow-up than controls. Results of this pilot study provide positive preliminary evidence that exercise during radiation may be beneficial for cancer patients. <EV> <t> Yoga improves quality of life and benefit finding in women undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer. <abs> This study examined the effects of yoga on quality of life (QOL) and psychosocial outcomes in women with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy. Sixty-one women were randomly assigned to either a yoga or a wait-list group. Yoga classes were taught biweekly during the 6 weeks of radiotherapy. Participants completed measures of QOL, fatigue, benefit finding (finding meaning in the cancer experience), intrusive thoughts, sleep disturbances, depressive symptoms, and anxiety before radiotherapy and then again 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the end of radiotherapy. General linear model analyses revealed that compared to the control group, the yoga group reported significantly better general health perception (p = .005) and physical functioning scores (p = .04) 1 week postradiotherapy; higher levels of intrusive thoughts 1 month postradiotherapy (p = .01); and greater benefit finding 3 months postradiotherapy (p = .01). There were no other group differences in other QOL subscales for fatigue, depression, or sleep scores. Exploratory analyses indicated that intrusive thoughts 1 month after radiotherapy were significantly positively correlated with benefit finding 3 months after radiotherapy (r = .36, p = .011). Our results indicated that the yoga program was associated with statistically and clinically significant improvements in aspects of QOL. <EV> <t> Restorative yoga for women with breast cancer: findings from a randomized pilot study. <abs> OBJECTIVES: Restorative yoga (RY) is a gentle type of yoga that may be beneficial for cancer patients and post-treatment survivors. Study goals were: to determine the feasibility of implementing a RY intervention for women with breast cancer; and to examine group differences in self-reported emotional, health-related quality of life, and symptom outcomes. METHODS: Women with breast cancer (n=44; mean age 55.8 years) enrolled in this study; 34% were actively undergoing cancer treatment. Study participants were randomized to the intervention (10 weekly 75-minute RY classes) or a waitlist control group. Participants completed questionnaires at Week 0 (baseline) and Week 10 (immediately post-intervention for the yoga group). RESULTS: Group differences favoring the yoga group were seen for mental health, depression, positive affect, and spirituality (peace/meaning). Significant baseline*group interactions were observed for negative affect and emotional well-being. Women with higher negative affect and lower emotional well-being at baseline derived greater benefit from the yoga intervention compared to those with similar values at baseline in the control group. The yoga group demonstrated a significant within-group improvement in fatigue; no significant difference was noted for the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by sample size, these pilot data suggest potential benefit of RY on emotional outcomes and fatigue in cancer patients. This study demonstrates that a RY intervention is feasible for women with breast cancer; implications for study design and implementation are noted with an emphasis on program adoption and participant adherence. <EV> <t> Effects of a scapula-oriented shoulder exercise programme on upper limb dysfunction in breast cancer survivors: a randomized controlled pilot trial. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a scapula-oriented exercise on upper limb dysfunction in breast cancer survivors. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized, controlled pilot trial with historical control. SETTING: Rehabilitation department at a university hospital. SUBJECTS: Thirty-two women with breast cancer were randomly assigned to scapula-oriented exercise group (n = 16) and general exercise group (n = 16). An historical control group (n = 18) without exercise was enrolled from breast cancer survivors. INTERVENTIONS: The scapula-oriented exercises were designed focusing on scapulothoracic movement. The general exercise group performed body conditioning exercise. Exercise therapies were performed for one session per week for eight weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain and physical disabilities related to upper limb dysfunction, quality of life and depression were used as subjective outcomes. Objective outcome measures included shoulder range of motion and strength. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and post exercise. RESULTS: At baseline, no significant difference was observed among the three groups. The scapula-oriented exercise group showed improvements in pain, physical function, social function, and global quality of life compared with baseline, whereas the general exercise group showed improved fatigue and range of motion. The change in global quality of life (P = 0.067; effect size, 0.33) and strength of external rotation (P = 0.001; effect size, 0.55) were significantly greater in the scapula-oriented exercise group than in the general exercise and control group. CONCLUSION: Scapula-oriented exercise had beneficial effects on pain, quality of life and aspects of strength. The sample size required in a larger definitive study is 32 subjects per group. <EV> <t> A randomized trial to increase physical activity in breast cancer survivors. <abs> PURPOSE: Interventions to increase physical activity among breast cancer survivors are needed to improve health and quality of life and possibly to reduce the risk of disease recurrence and early mortality. Therefore, we report the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of a pilot randomized trial designed to increase physical activity in sedentary breast cancer survivors receiving hormone therapy. METHODS: Forty-one sedentary women on estrogen receptor modulators or aromatase inhibitors for stage I, II, or IIIA breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive a 12-wk multidisciplinary physical activity behavior change intervention or usual care. RESULTS: Recruitment was 34%, intervention adherence was 99%, and complete follow-up data were obtained on 93%. Most participants (93%) were white with mean age of 53 +/- 9 yr. Differences favoring the intervention group were noted for accelerometer physical activity counts (mean difference = 72,103; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 25,383-119,000; effect size (d) = 1.02; P = 0.004), aerobic fitness (mean difference = 2.9; 95% CI = -0.1 to 5.8; d = 0.64; P = 0.058), back/leg muscle strength (mean difference = 12.3; 95% CI = 0.4-15.9; d = 0.81; P = 0.017), waist-to-hip ratio (mean difference = -0.05; 95% CI = -0.01 to -0.08; d = -0.77; P = 0.018), and social well-being (mean difference = 2.0; 95% CI = 0.3-3.8; d = 0.76; P = 0.03). However, the intervention group also reported a greater increase in joint stiffness (mean difference = 1.1; 95% CI = 0.1-2.2; d = 0.70; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: A behavior change intervention for breast cancer survivors based on the social cognitive theory is feasible and results in potentially meaningful improvements in physical activity and selected health outcomes. Confirmation in a larger study is warranted. <EV> <t> Effects of aerobic exercise training in anemic cancer patients receiving darbepoetin alfa: a randomized controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Anemia in patients with solid tumors is a common problem that is associated with impaired exercise capacity, increased fatigue, and lower quality of life (QoL). Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have been shown to improve these outcomes; however, it is unknown if additional benefits can be achieved with aerobic exercise training. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial in 55 mild-to-moderately anemic patients with solid tumors. Patients were randomized to either darbepoetin alfa alone (DAL, n = 29) or darbepoetin alfa plus aerobic exercise training (DEX; n = 26). The DEX group performed aerobic exercise training three times per week at 60%-100% of baseline exercise capacity for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was QoL assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia scale. Secondary endpoints were fatigue, cardiorespiratory fitness (VO(2peak)), hemoglobin (Hb) response, and darbepoetin alfa dosing. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated significant improvements in QoL and fatigue in both groups over time but there were no between-group differences. The DEX group had a significantly greater VO(2peak) than the DAL group (mean group difference, +3.0 ml/kg per minute; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.7; p = .001) and there were borderline significant differences in favor of the DEX group for Hb response and darbepoetin alfa dosing. CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise training did not improve QoL or fatigue beyond the established benefits of DAL but it did result in favorable improvements in exercise capacity and a more rapid Hb response with lower dosing requirements. Our results may be useful to clinicians despite the more recent restrictions on the indications for ESAs. <EV> <t> Randomized controlled trial of the effects of aerobic exercise on physical functioning and quality of life in lymphoma patients. <abs> PURPOSE: Lymphoma patients commonly experience declines in physical functioning and quality of life (QoL) that may be reversed with exercise training. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, between 2005 and 2008 that stratified 122 lymphoma patients by major disease type and current treatment status and randomly assigned them to usual care (UC; n = 62) or 12 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise training (AET; n = 60). Our primary end point was patient-rated physical functioning assessed by the Trial Outcome Index-Anemia. Secondary end points were overall QoL, psychosocial functioning, cardiovascular fitness, and body composition. RESULTS: Follow-up assessment for our primary end point was 96% (117 of 122) at postintervention and 90% (110 of 122) at 6-month follow-up. Median adherence to the supervised exercise program was 92%. At postintervention, AET was superior to UC for patient-rated physical functioning (mean group difference, +9.0; 95% CI, 2.0 to 16.0; P = .012), overall QoL (P = .021), fatigue (P = .013), happiness (P = .004), depression (P = .005), general health (P < .001), cardiovascular fitness (P < .001), and lean body mass (P = .008). Change in peak cardiovascular fitness mediated the change in patient-rated physical functioning. AET did not interfere with chemotherapy completion rate or treatment response. At 6-month follow-up, AET was still borderline or significantly superior to UC for overall QoL (P = .054), happiness (P = .034), and depression (P = .009) without an increased risk of disease recurrence/progression. CONCLUSION: AET significantly improved important patient-rated outcomes and objective physical functioning in lymphoma patients without interfering with medical treatments or response. Exercise training to improve cardiovascular fitness should be considered in the management of lymphoma patients. <EV> <t> Effect of exercise on biomarkers, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and depressive symptoms in older women with breast cancer receiving hormonal therapy. <abs> PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of a prescribed home-based walking exercise intervention with usual care in older women receiving hormonal treatment for breast cancer, and to examine relationships among levels of the cortisol, serotonin, interleukin-6, and bilirubin biomarkers and fatigue, sleep disturbances, and depressive symptoms. DESIGN: Longitudinal randomized clinical trial. SETTING: A National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center in the southeastern United States. SAMPLE: 20 women (aged 55 years or older) with breast cancer receiving hormonal treatment. METHODS: Participants were randomized to a walking exercise intervention or usual care. Laboratory samples and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Piper Revised Fatigue Scale, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale were collected at the initial clinic visit and at 12 weeks from the groups. Questionnaires also were collected at weeks 2 and 14. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Fatigue, sleep disturbances, depressive symptoms, biomarkers, and exercise. FINDINGS: Effect of the exercise intervention on sleep scores was highly significant between groups. Exercise group scores on the PSQI decreased significantly over time (indicating improved sleep quality), although scores did not change significantly within the control group. Sleep actigraphy also showed significantly shorter actual wake time and less movement in the exercise group. Serotonin levels also were significantly affected by the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that a walking exercise intervention improves sleep in older women receiving hormonal treatment for their breast cancer. Serotonin levels may be a useful biomarker when assessing sleep disturbances in this group. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Clinicians need to be aware that older women receiving hormonal treatment for their breast cancer may experience fatigue, sleep disturbances, and depressive symptoms. Homebased walking activity may reduce symptom severity in this group. <EV> <t> Medical Qigong for cancer patients: pilot study of impact on quality of life, side effects of treatment and inflammation. <abs> Quality of life (QOL) of cancer patients is often diminished due to the side effects of treatment and symptoms of the disease itself. Medical Qigong (coordination of gentle exercise and relaxation through meditation and breathing exercise based on Chinese medicine theory of energy channels) may be an effective therapy for improving QOL, symptoms and side effects, and longevity of cancer patients. In this pilot study, the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of Medical Qigong (MQ) were evaluated on outcomes in cancer patients. Thirty patients diagnosed with heterogeneous cancers, were randomly assigned to two groups: a control group that received usual medical care and an intervention group who participated in a MQ program for 8 weeks in addition to receiving usual medical care. Randomization was stratified by completion of cancer treatment (n = 14) or under chemotherapy (n = 16). Patients completed measures before and after the program. Quality of life and symptoms were measured by the EORTC QLQ-C 30 and progress of disease by the inflammation biomarker (CRP: c-reactive protein) via a blood test was assessed. The MQ intervention group reported clinically significant improved global QOL scores pre- and post-intervention. The MQ intervention also reduced the symptoms of side effects of cancer treatment and inflammation biomarker (CRP) compare to the control group. Due to the small sample size, however, the results were not statistically significant between treatment and the control groups. Data from the pilot study suggest that MQ with usual medical treatment can enhance the QOL of cancer patients and reduce inflammation. This study needs a further investigation with a larger sample size. <EV> <t> Randomized controlled trial of resistance or aerobic exercise in men receiving radiation therapy for prostate cancer. <abs> PURPOSE: Radiotherapy for prostate cancer (PCa) may cause unfavorable changes in fatigue, quality of life (QOL), and physical fitness. We report results from the Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy and Exercise Versus Normal Treatment study examining the effects of 24 weeks of resistance or aerobic training versus usual care on fatigue, QOL, physical fitness, body composition, prostate-specific antigen, testosterone, hemoglobin, and lipid levels in men with PCa receiving radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2003 and 2006, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in Ottawa, Canada, where 121 PCa patients initiating radiotherapy with or without androgen deprivation therapy were randomly assigned to usual care (n = 41), resistance (n = 40), or aerobic exercise (n = 40) for 24 weeks. Our primary end point was fatigue assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue scale. RESULTS: The follow-up assessment rate for our primary end point of fatigue was 92.6%. Median adherence to prescribed exercise was 85.5%. Mixed-model repeated measures analyses indicated both resistance (P =.010) and aerobic exercise (P = .004) mitigated fatigue over the short term. Resistance exercise also produced longer-term improvements (P = .002). Compared with usual care, resistance training improved QOL (P = .015), aerobic fitness (P = .041), upper- (P < .001) and lower-body (P < .001) strength, and triglycerides (P = .036), while preventing an increase in body fat (P = .049). Aerobic training also improved fitness (P = .052). One serious adverse event occurred in the group that performed aerobic exercise. CONCLUSION: In the short term, both resistance and aerobic exercise mitigated fatigue in men with PCa receiving radiotherapy. Resistance exercise generated longer-term improvements and additional benefits for QOL, strength, triglycerides, and body fat. <EV> <t> Effect of a multimodal high intensity exercise intervention in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy: randomised controlled trial. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multimodal group exercise intervention, as an adjunct to conventional care, on fatigue, physical capacity, general wellbeing, physical activity, and quality of life in patients with cancer who were undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy or treatment for advanced disease. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Two university hospitals in Copenhagen, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 269 patients with cancer; 73 men, 196 women, mean age 47 years (range 20-65) representing 21 diagnoses. Main exclusion criteria were brain or bone metastases. 235 patients completed follow-up. INTERVENTION: Supervised exercise comprising high intensity cardiovascular and resistance training, relaxation and body awareness training, massage, nine hours weekly for six weeks in addition to conventional care, compared with conventional care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (MOS SF-36), Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, muscular strength (one repetition maximum), maximum oxygen consumption (Vo(2)max). Statistical methods The general linear model was used for continuous outcome while analysis of associates between categorical outcomes was performed as analysis of marginal homogeneity in contingency tables. RESULTS: Adjusted for baseline score, disease, and demographic covariates, the intervention group showed an estimated improvement at six weeks for the primary outcome, fatigue, of -6.6 points (95% confidence interval -12.3 to -0.9, P=0.02; effect size=0.33, 0.04 to 0.61). Significant effects were seen on vitality (effect size 0.55, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.82), physical functioning (0.37, 0.09 to 0.65), role physical (0.37, 0.10 to 0.64), role emotional (0.32, 0.05 to 0.59), and mental health (0.28, 0.02 to 0.56) scores. Improvement was noted in physical capacity: estimated mean difference between groups for maximum oxygen consumption was 0.16 l/min (95% CI 0.1 to 0.2, P<0.0001) and for muscular strength (leg press) was 29.7 kg (23.4 to 34.9, P<0.0001). No significant effect was seen on global health status/quality of life. CONCLUSION: A supervised multimodal exercise intervention including high and low intensity components was feasible and could safely be used in patients with various cancers who were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy or treatment for advanced disease. The intervention reduced fatigue and improved vitality, aerobic capacity, muscular strength, and physical and functional activity, and emotional wellbeing, but not quality of life. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled trials ISRCTN05322922. <EV> <t> Effect of exercise on upper extremity pain and dysfunction in head and neck cancer survivors: a randomized controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Shoulder pain and disability are well recognized complications associated with surgery for head and neck cancer. This study was designed to examine the effects of progressive resistance exercise training (PRET) on upper extremity pain and dysfunction in postsurgical head and neck cancer survivors. METHODS: Fifty-two head and neck cancer survivors were assigned randomly to PRET (n = 27) or a standardized therapeutic exercise protocol (TP) (n = 25) for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in patient-rated shoulder pain and disability from baseline to postintervention. Secondary endpoints were upper extremity strength and endurance, range of motion, fatigue, and quality of life. RESULTS: Follow-up assessment for the primary outcome was 92%, and adherence to the supervised PRET and TP programs were 95% and 87%, respectively. On the basis of intention-to-treat analyses, PRET was superior to TP for improving shoulder pain and disability (-9.6; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], -16.4 to -4.5; P = .001), upper extremity strength (+10.8 kg; 95% CI, 5.4-16.2 kg; P < .001), and upper extremity endurance (+194 repetitions x kg; 95% CI, 10-378 repetitions x kg; P = .039). Changes in neck dissection impairment, fatigue, and quality of life favored the PRET group but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: The PRET program significantly reduced shoulder pain and disability and improved upper extremity muscular strength and endurance in head and neck cancer survivors who had shoulder dysfunction because of spinal accessory nerve damage. Clinicians should consider the addition of PRET in the rehabilitation of postsurgical head and neck cancer survivors. <EV> <t> Effects of a combined aerobic and resistance exercise program in breast cancer survivors: a randomized controlled trial. <abs> Few randomized controlled trials have examined the effects of combined aerobic and resistance training in breast cancer survivors soon after completing adjuvant therapy. Breast cancer survivors (N=58) within 2 years of completing adjuvant therapy were randomly assigned to an immediate exercise group (IEG; n=29) or a delayed exercise group (DEG; n=29). The IEG completed 12 weeks of supervised aerobic and resistance exercise, three times per week. The DEG completed the program during the next 12 weeks. Participants completed patient-rated outcomes at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall quality of life (QoL) measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast scale. Secondary endpoints were fatigue, social physique anxiety, and physical fitness. Follow-up data was obtained on 97% of participants and exercise adherence was 61.3%. Repeated measures analyses of variance revealed a significant group by time interaction for overall QoL (P<0.001). Specifically, QoL increased in the IEG from baseline to 12 weeks by 20.8 points compared to a decrease in the DEG of 5.3 points (mean group difference=26.1; 95% CI=18.3-32.7; P<0.001). From 12 to 24 weeks, QoL increased in the DEG by 29.5 points compared to an increase of 6.5 points in the IEG (mean group difference=23.0; 95% CI=16.3-29.1; P<0.001). Similar results were obtained for the secondary endpoints. Combined aerobic and resistance exercise soon after the completion of breast cancer therapy produces large and rapid improvements in health-related outcomes. <EV> <t> Impact of medical Qigong on quality of life, fatigue, mood and inflammation in cancer patients: a randomized controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Substantial numbers of cancer patients use complementary medicine therapies, even without a supportive evidence base. This study aimed to evaluate in a randomized controlled trial, the use of Medical Qigong (MQ) compared with usual care to improve the quality of life (QOL) of cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and sixty-two patients with a range of cancers were recruited. QOL and fatigue were measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue, respectively, and mood status by Profile of Mood State. The inflammatory marker serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was monitored serially. RESULTS: Regression analysis indicated that the MQ group significantly improved overall QOL (t(144) = -5.761, P < 0.001), fatigue (t(153) = -5.621, P < 0.001), mood disturbance (t(122) =2.346, P = 0.021) and inflammation (CRP) (t(99) = 2.042, P < 0.044) compared with usual care after controlling for baseline variables. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that MQ can improve cancer patients' overall QOL and mood status and reduce specific side-effects of treatment. It may also produce physical benefits in the long term through reduced inflammation.", "summary:reference": "The findings of the updated review have enabled a more precise conclusion to be made in that aerobic exercise can be regarded as beneficial for individuals with cancer-related fatigue during and post-cancer therapy, specifically those with solid tumours.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Doxycycline and rifampicin for mild scrub-typhus infections in northern Thailand: a randomised trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Some strains of scrub typhus in northern Thailand are poorly responsive to standard antirickettsial drugs. We therefore did a masked, randomised trial to compare rifampicin with standard doxycycline therapy for patients with scrub typhus. METHODS: Adult patients with strictly defined, mild scrub typhus were initially randomly assigned 1 week of daily oral treatment with 200 mg doxycycline (n=40), 600 mg rifampicin (n=38), or doxycycline with rifampicin (n=11). During the first year of treatment, the combined regimen was withdrawn because of lack of efficacy and the regimen was replaced with 900 mg rifampicin (n=37). Treatment outcome was assessed by fever clearance time (the time for oral temperature to fall below 37.3 degrees C). FINDINGS: About 12,800 fever patients were screened during the 3-year study to recruit 126 patients with confirmed scrub typhus and no other infection, of whom 86 completed therapy. Eight individuals received the combined regimen that was discontinued after 1 year. The median duration of pyrexia was significantly shorter (p=0.01) in the 24 patients treated with 900 mg daily rifampicin (fever clearance time 22.5 h) and in the 26 patients who received 600 mg rifampicin (fever clearance time 27.5 h) than in the 28 patients given doxycycline monotherapy (fever clearance time 52 h).

The aim of the study was to investigate the antipsychotic potential of trimipramine in a controlled clinical trial comparing its antipsychotic efficacy with that of a neuroleptic. METHOD: In a German multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial, the antipsychotic efficacy of trimipramine was compared with that of the phenothiazine neuroleptic perazine, using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and Clinical Global Impressions (CGI). Antidepressant efficacy of both agents was measured by use of the Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale (BRMES). Ninety-five patients with acute schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) and a BPRS total score > 40 at baseline were treated with either 300-400 mg trimipramine or 450-600 mg perazine for 5 weeks. RESULTS: Therapeutic equivalence of both treatments (in the dosages used) could not be demonstrated (change in BPRS total score, per-protocol [PP] analysis, one-sided equivalence testing). However, intention-to-treat (ITT) as well as PP analysis showed a statistically significant decrease in the BPRS total scores in both treatment groups (PP: trimipramine, 56.5 +/- 9.8 to 44.1 +/- 17.9; perazine, 56.4 +/- 10.8 to 37.9 +/- 12.9). Significant decreases in all BPRS and PANSS subscores as well as CGI results and response rate support the antipsychotic efficacy of trimipramine. The BRMES total scores significantly decreased in both treatment groups without showing a significant difference between the two agents.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Efficacy and safety of high-dose budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort) compared with budesonide administered either concomitantly with formoterol or alone in patients with persistent symptomatic asthma. <abs> OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: Budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 microg, two inhalations bd, is an effective and well-tolerated maintenance therapy for patients not controlled on inhaled corticosteroids alone. The authors assessed the efficacy and safety of a higher dose of budesonide/formoterol in patients with persistent symptomatic asthma. METHODS: This was a 24-week, double-blind, double-dummy randomized study. Budesonide/formoterol 320/9 microg, two inhalations bd (1280/36 microg/day), was compared with corresponding doses of budesonide during weeks 1-12 and budesonide plus formoterol via separate inhalers during weeks 1-24. Efficacy was assessed during weeks 1-12; the primary variable was morning PEF. Safety was assessed over weeks 1-24. RESULTS: Patients (n=456; aged 12-79 years) had a mean reversibility in FEV1 of 28% and mean pre-study inhaled corticosteroid dose of 1038 microg/day. Mean morning PEF increased by 37 L/min and 36 L/min with budesonide/formoterol and budesonide plus formoterol, respectively, versus an increase of 5 L/min with budesonide (P<0.001 for both vs. budesonide). Budesonide/formoterol increased time to first mild exacerbation (P<0.005) versus budesonide. Budesonide/formoterol and budesonide plus formoterol had similar efficacy. All treatments were well tolerated and the incidence of class-related adverse events was similarly low in all groups. Changes in serum potassium and plasma cortisol were comparable across treatments. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose budesonide/formoterol (320/9 microg, two inhalations bd) is effective and well tolerated in patients with persistent symptomatic asthma. The findings also support the safety of regular high-dose formoterol (36 microg/day). <EV> <t> Comparison of the effects of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate with fluticasone propionate on airway physiology in adults with mild persistent asthma. <abs> BACKGROUND: This study compared the effect of inhaled fluticasone propionate (FP) with the combination of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (SFC) on lung function parameters in patients with mild asthma. METHODS: Adult patients with mild persistent asthma (> or = 80% predicted FEV1) receiving 200-500 mug of BDP or equivalent were randomised to receive either FP 100 mug or SFC 50/100 mug twice daily from a Diskus inhaler for four weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in airway resistance (sRaw) at 12 hrs post dose measured by whole body plethysmography. Impulse oscillometry and spirometry were also performed. RESULTS: A comparison of the geometric mean sRaw at 12 hrs post dose in the SFC group to the FP group gave a ratio of 0.76 (0.66 - 0.89, p < 0.001) at week 2 and 0.81 (0.71 - 0.94, p = 0.006) at week 4. Similarly, significant results in favour of SFC for oscillometry measurements of resistance and reactance were observed. FEV1 was also significantly superior at week 2 in the SFC group (mean difference 0.16L, 95% CI; 0.03 - 0.28, p = 0.015), but not at week 4 (mean difference 0.17L, 95% CI -0.01 - 0.34, p = 0.060). CONCLUSION: SFC is superior to FP in reducing airway resistance in mild asthmatics with near normal FEV1 values. This study provides evidence that changes in pulmonary function in patients with mild asthma are detected more sensitively by plethysmography compared to spirometry TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00370591. <EV> <t> Asthma exacerbations in African Americans treated for 1 year with combination fluticasone propionate and salmeterol or fluticasone propionate alone. <abs> OBJECTIVE: This long-term prospective study was conducted in African Americans with persistent asthma to examine the safety and effectiveness of the combination of the inhaled corticosteroid, fluticasone propionate (FP), and the long-acting beta-agonist, salmeterol, compared with FP alone. RESEARCH AND DESIGN METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multi-center trial in adolescent and adult subjects >/=12 years of age symptomatic on a low dose of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). The study consisted of a 2-week screening period on low dose ICS; a 4-week open-label FP 250 mcg twice daily (BID) run-in; a 52-week double-blind period (FP/salmeterol [FSC] 100/50 mcg [n=239] or FP 100 mcg [n=236] BID), and a 4-week FP 250 mcg BID run-out period. Annualized exacerbation rate was the primary outcome for comparing the two treatments. Other measures of asthma control included peak expiratory flow, asthma symptoms, and albuterol use. Safety was assessed through adverse events. RESULTS: Exacerbation rates were not significantly different in those treated with FSC 100/50 mcg (0.449 per year) compared with FP 100 mcg (0.529 per year, p=0.169). When the per-protocol analysis was applied, the rates were 0.465 and 0.769 per year for FSC 100/50 mcg and FP 100 mcg, respectively. Treatment with FSC 100/50 mcg provided statistically greater improvements in lung function measures and nighttime awakenings (p</=0.050) and demonstrated numerically lower daily symptoms (p=0.216) and albuterol use (p=0.122). Two subjects treated with FSC 100/50 mcg were hospitalized for an asthma exacerbation compared to three treated with FP 100 mcg. The overall incidence of adverse effects during double-blind treatment was similar between the FSC 100/50 mcg and FP 100 mcg treatment groups (61% and 68%, respectively). Frequent study visits were required of subjects during this long-term study, and it remains unknown whether this intervention may affect generalizability. CONCLUSION: In this large, prospective study among African Americans with asthma, the addition of salmeterol to FP resulted in a similar low rate of exacerbations and improved other markers of asthma control. Both FSC 100/50 mcg and FP 100 mcg were well-tolerated, and the overall safety-profiles were similar over 1 year of treatment. <EV> <t> Adding salmeterol to an inhaled corticosteroid: long term effects on bronchial inflammation in asthma. <abs> BACKGROUND: Addition of the long acting beta2 agonist salmeterol to inhaled corticosteroids leads to better symptomatic asthma control than increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids. However, little is known about the long term effects of adding salmeterol on the asthmatic inflammatory process, control of which is considered important for the long term outcome of asthma. METHODS: After a 4 week fluticasone run-in period, 54 patients with allergic asthma were randomised to receive twice daily treatment with fluticasone 250 microg with or without salmeterol 50 microg for 1 year in a double blind, parallel group design (total daily dose of fluticasone 500 microg in both treatment groups). Primary outcomes were sputum eosinophil numbers and eosinophil cationic protein concentrations. Secondary outcomes were neutrophil associated sputum parameters and a respiratory membrane permeability marker. The effects on allergen induced changes were determined before and at the end of the treatment period. RESULTS: Adding salmeterol to fluticasone resulted in improved peak expiratory flow, symptom scores, rescue medication usage, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (p < 0.05 for all). There was no sustained effect on sputum cell differential counts and cytokine concentrations during the treatment period or on changes induced by allergen challenge at the end of treatment (p > 0.05). However, adding salmeterol significantly reduced sputum ratios of alpha2-macroglobulin and albumin during the treatment period (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of salmeterol to fluticasone produces no sustained effect on allergen induced cellular bronchial inflammation but leads to a significant improvement in size selectivity of plasma protein permeation across the respiratory membrane. This may contribute to the improved clinical outcome seen in patients with allergic asthma when a long acting beta2 agonist is combined with inhaled corticosteroids. <EV> <t> Once-daily dosing with budesonide/formoterol compared with twice-daily budesonide/formoterol and once-daily budesonide in adults with mild to moderate asthma. <abs> Adherence to maintenance therapy is often poor in patients with asthma. Simplifying dosing regimens has the potential to improve both adherence and asthma-related morbidity. In this 12-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study, 617 patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma (mean forced expiratory volume in 1s [FEV1] 78.5% predicted) who were not optimally controlled on inhaled corticosteroids (200-500 microg/day) were randomized to once-daily budesonide/formoterol (80/4.5 microg, 2 inhalations in the evening), twice-daily budesonide/formoterol (80/4.5 microg, 1 inhalation), or a corresponding dose of budesonide once-daily (200 microg, 1 inhalation in the evening). All patients received budesonide (100 microg twice daily) during a 2-week run-in. Changes in mean morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) were similar for od budesonide/formoterol (23.4 l/min) and twice-daily budesonide/formoterol (24.1 l/min), and both were greater than with budesonide (5.5 l/min; both P<0.001). Evening PEF, symptom-free days, reliever-free days, and asthma control days were improved with budesonide/formoterol therapy vs. budesonide (P<0.05 vs. budesonide for all variables). All treatments were well tolerated. Budesonide/formoterol administered once daily in the evening is a convenient treatment regimen that is as effective in improving asthma control as twice-daily dosing in patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma. <EV> <t> The safety of twice-daily treatment with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol in pediatric patients with persistent asthma. <abs> BACKGROUND: For children older than 5 years with asthma who remain symptomatic despite inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy, the preferred treatment is to add an inhaled long-acting beta2-agonist vs increasing the ICS dose. OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety of twice-daily treatment with inhaled fluticasone propionate plus the inhaled long-acting beta2-agonist salmeterol with that of fluticasone propionate used alone in children aged 4 to 11 years with persistent asthma. METHODS: A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group study in 203 children with persistent asthma who were symptomatic during ICS therapy. Patients received fluticasone propionate-salmeterol (100/50 microg) or fluticasone propionate (100 microg) alone twice daily for 12 weeks. RESULTS: The safety profile of fluticasone propionate-salmeterol was similar to that of fluticasone propionate alone. The overall incidence of adverse events was 59% for fluticasone propionate-salmeterol and 57% for fluticasone propionate. Both treatments were well tolerated. Two patients receiving fluticasone propionate-salmeterol and 5 receiving fluticasone propionate withdrew from the study because of worsening asthma. Changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and laboratory variables were infrequent and were similar between treatments. No patients had clinically significant abnormal electrocardiographic findings during treatment. Geometric mean 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment was comparable within and between groups; no patient in either group had abnormally low 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion after 12 weeks of treatment. The incidence of withdrawals due to asthma exacerbations was 2% in the fluticasone propionate-salmeterol group and 5% in the fluticasone propionate group. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients with persistent asthma, fluticasone propionate-salmeterol twice daily was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of fluticasone propionate used alone. <EV> <t> Comparison of asthma treatment given in addition to inhaled corticosteroids on airway inflammation and responsiveness. <abs> There is increasing evidence that the assessment of eosinophilic airway inflammation using induced sputum and measurement of airway hyperresponsiveness provides additional, clinically important information concerning asthma control. The aim of this study was to directly compare the effects of different treatments on these markers in patients with asthma and persistent symptoms, despite the use of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids. A double-blind four-way crossover study was performed, which compared a 1-month treatment with budesonide 400 mug b.i.d., additional formoterol, additional montelukast and placebo in 49 patients with uncontrolled asthma despite budesonide 100 mug b.i.d., with each treatment separated by a 4-week washout period. The change in sputum eosinophil count with formoterol (2.4 to 3.8% change, 0.6-fold reduction, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5-0.9) differed significantly from placebo (2.8 to 2.5% change, 1.1-fold reduction, 95% CI 0.7-1.6) and high-dose budesonide (2.7 to 1.6% change, 1.6-fold reduction, 95% CI 1.2-2.2). The effects of montelukast did not differ from placebo. The changes in methacholine airway responsiveness were small and did not differ between treatments. High-dose budesonide had the broadest range of beneficial effects on other outcomes, including symptom scores, morning peak expiratory flow and forced expiratory volume in one second. In conclusion, treatment given in addition to low-dose inhaled corticosteroids results in modest benefits. Formoterol and high-dose budesonide have contrasting effects on eosinophilic airway inflammation. <EV> <t> A randomized, double-blind trial of the effect of anti-asthma treatment on lung function in children with asthma. <abs> BACKGROUND: Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and especially spirometry measures are useful tools in evaluating early response to treatment of asthma in children mainly due to their worldwide availability. The aim of our study was to determine the effects of anti-asthma treatment in children, equally on FEV(1), FEF25-75%, R(int) and SR(aw) values. METHODS: Children 6-18 years of age with moderate atopic asthma were randomized to 4-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Patients were randomly allocated to receive 200 microg budesonide (B) (n=29), 5 or 10 mg (according to age) montelukast (M) (n=29), 200 microg B + 5 or 10 mg M (n=29), 200 microg B + 9 microg formoterol (F) (n=29) or placebo (n=27). FEV(1,) FEF25-75%, R(int), SR(aw) were measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: R(int), SR(aw), FEV(1) improved significantly in all active treatment groups while FEF25-75% improved significantly only in BM group and M group. Combination therapy, showed significantly greater effects on R(int) than monotherapy: BM group compared to B group (P=0.01) and M group (P=0.03) and BF group compared to B group (P=0.01) and M group (P=0.04). CONCLUSION: This study shows that using single parameter for monitoring asthma can be misleading. Using combination of lung function techniques provides better assessment of treatment. Results of our study confirm this hypothesis. The best effect on large and small airways was achieved with combined anti-inflammatory therapy. <EV> <t> Efficacy and safety of budesonide and formoterol in one pressurised metered-dose inhaler in adults and adolescents with moderate to severe asthma: a randomised clinical trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the preferred maintenance therapy for adults and children with mild, moderate and severe persistent asthma, with the addition of a long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist to ICS therapy recommended for patients with moderate or severe persistent asthma. The efficacy and safety of the combination of budesonide and formoterol delivered via dry powder inhaler (DPI) is well documented. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of budesonide/formoterol pressurised metered-dose inhaler (budesonide/formoterol pMDI; Symbicort pMDI, AstraZeneca LP, Wilmington, DE, USA) with budesonide pMDI (Pulmicort pMDI, Astra [corrected] Zeneca, Lund, Sweden), formoterol DPI (Oxis Turbuhaler, AstraZeneca, Lund, Sweden), budesonide plus formoterol in separate inhalers (budesonide pMDI + formoterol DPI) and placebo. STUDY DESIGN: This was a 12-week randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: This multicentre study was conducted in the respiratory specialty clinical practice setting. PATIENTS: The study included 596 patients > or =12 years of age with moderate to severe persistent asthma previously receiving ICSs. INTERVENTIONS: After 2 weeks on budesonide pMDI 80 microg x two inhalations (160 microg) twice daily, patients received budesonide/formoterol pMDI 160 microg/4.5 microg x two inhalations (320 microg/9 microg); budesonide pMDI 160 microg x two inhalations (320 microg) + formoterol DPI 4.5 microg x two inhalations (9 microg); budesonide pMDI 160 microg x two inhalations (320 microg); formoterol DPI 4.5 microg x two inhalations (9 microg); or placebo twice daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: There were two prespecified primary efficacy variables: mean change from baseline in morning predose forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), obtained approximately 12 hours after the most recent administration of study medication at home and immediately before the next administration of study medication at the clinic; and mean change from baseline in 12-hour FEV(1), assessed as the average change in FEV(1) from serial spirometry over the 12-hour period after administration of the morning dose of study medication at the clinic. RESULTS: Mean changes from baseline in morning predose FEV(1) at end of treatment were greater (p < or = 0.049) with budesonide/formoterol pMDI (0.19L) versus budesonide pMDI (0.10L), formoterol DPI (-0.12L) and placebo (-0.17L). Mean changes from baseline in 12-hour FEV(1) were greater (p < or = 0.001) with budesonide/formoterol pMDI after 1 day (0.37L), 2 weeks (0.34L) and at end of treatment (0.37L) versus budesonide pMDI (0.11, 0.15 and 0.15L) and placebo (0.09, -0.03 and -0.03L), and after 2 weeks and at end of treatment versus formoterol DPI (0.19 and 0.17L). Fewer (p < or = 0.025) patients receiving budesonide/formoterol pMDI versus monoproducts or placebo met worsening asthma criteria. Results were similar in the budesonide/formoterol pMDI group and the budesonide pMDI + formoterol DPI group on all measures. All treatments were well tolerated with similar safety profiles. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, twice-daily budesonide/formoterol pMDI provides asthma control significantly greater than the monocomponents or placebo and comparable with budesonide pMDI + formoterol DPI. Safety profiles were similar for all treatments. <EV> <t> Efficacy and tolerability of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol administered twice daily via hydrofluoroalkane 134a metered-dose inhaler in adolescent and adult patients with persistent asthma: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week study. <abs> OBJECTIVE: This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of fluticasone propionate (FP) and salmeterol (SAL) delivered via a single hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) 134a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with those of its 2 components alone delivered via a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) MDI and placebo (PLA) delivered via HFA MDI in adolescent and adult patients with persistent asthma that was not controlled by medium doses (equivalent to FP 440-660 microg/d) of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled, parallel-group study consisting of a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period followed by a 12-week, double-blind treatment period. Participants had to be > or =12 years of age and have a diagnosis of asthma requiring pharmacotherapy for at least 6 months before the study. Patients had to have used ICS therapy for > or =3 months before the study and at a consistent dose for the previous month. Lack of asthma control was defined as a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) that was 40% to 85% of the predicted value. Patients could not enter the double-blind treatment period if they had 3 days when they required >12 puffs of rescue albuterol per day or >3 nighttime awakenings due to asthma that required treatment with albuterol during the 7 days before the randomization visit. Patients were randomized to receive one of the following treatments delivered via MDI twice daily for 12 weeks: FSC 220/42 microg HFA (2 inhalations of FSC 110/21 microg; 125 microg/21 microg ex-valve); FP 220 microg CFC (2 inhalations of FP 110 microg); SAL 42 microg CFC (2 inhalations of 21 microg); or 2 inhalations of PLA HFA. The primary efficacy end point for FSC versus FP was the mean area under the 12-hour serial FEV(1) curve relative to the prerandomization baseline (FEV(1) AUC(bl)). The primary efficacy end points for FSC versus SAL were the mean change from baseline in morning predose FEV(1) at end point and the probability of not being withdrawn from the study due to worsening asthma. Tolerability assessments included electrocardiograms, routine clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, oropharyngeal examinations, and physical examinations. Adverse events were assessed at each clinic visit. RESULTS: Thirty-two adolescent and 333 adult patients were randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment. The treatment groups were comparable at baseline with respect to demographic characteristics (mean age, 38-41 years; white race, 78%-88%) and pulmonary function (mean percent predicted FEV(1), 68%-69%; mean asthma symptom score, 1.6 [scale 0-5]; and mean daily albuterol use, 3.1 puffs). After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean FEV(1) AUC(bl) was significantly greater in patients who received FSC compared with those who received FP, SAL, or PLA (7.0, 3.6, 5.3, and 1.4 L-h, respectively; all comparisons, P < or = 0.020). At end point, the mean change from baseline in morning predose FEV(1) for FSC was significantly greater than that for FP, SAL, and PLA (0.41, 0.19, 0.15, and -0.12 L; all comparisons, P < or = 0.001). During 12 weeks of treatment, 7% of patients receiving FSC were withdrawn due to worsening asthma, compared with 24% of patients receiving SAL and 54% of patients receiving PLA (P < 0.001); 11% of patients receiving FP were withdrawn due to worsening asthma. Treatment with FSC resulted in significant improvements in morning and evening peak expiratory flow compared with FP, SAL, and PLA (both, P < 0.001); need for rescue albuterol compared with FP and PLA (P < or =0.005); and asthma symptom scores compared with PLA (P < 0.001). The tolerability of FSC was similar to that of FP or SAL alone. The incidence of possibly drug-related adverse events was generally similar across treatment groups, and the most common (occurring in > or= 2% of patients) were headache (1%-4%), throat irritation (1%-2%), candidiasis of the mouth/throat (0%-2%), unspecified oropharyngeal plaques (0%-2%), and palpitations (0%-2%). CONCLUSIONS: In these adolescent and adult patients whose asthma was not controlled by medium doses of an ICS, FSC delivered via HFA 134a MDI (2 inhalations of 110/21-microg strength administered BID) was more effective in improving lung function than FP or SAL monotherapy or PLA. All treatments were well tolerated. <EV> <t> Effect of fluticasone/salmeterol administered via a single device on exercise-induced bronchospasm in patients with persistent asthma. <abs> BACKGROUND: Exercise is a common trigger of asthma symptoms in patients with persistent asthma. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the protective effect of fluticasone/salmeterol against exercise-induced bronchospasm. METHODS: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial of 192 asthma patients who used moderate-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Patients (aged 12-50 years; mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1], 78% of predicted at baseline) were randomized to receive fluticasone/salmeterol (250/50 microg twice daily) or fluticasone alone (250 microg twice daily) via Diskus for 4 weeks. Exercise challenge tests were performed 1 and 8.5 hours after administration of the first (day 1) and last (week 4) doses of blinded study medication. RESULTS: On day 1 and at week 4, mean +/- SEM values for the maximal percentage decline in FEV1 1 hour after drug administration were 11.4% +/- 1.5% and 10.9% +/- 1.5% for fluticasone/salmeterol compared with 20.0% +/- 1.7% and 18.4% +/- 1.8% for fluticasone (P < .001). At 8.5 hours, mean +/- SEM values on day 1 and at week 4 were 11.6% +/- 1.4% and 8.9% +/1.1%, respectively, for fluticasone/salmeterol and 12.6% +/- 1.6% and 12.9% +/- 1.4%, respectively, for fluticasone (P = .01 at week 4). More fluticasone-treated patients did not complete the 8.5-hour exercise challenges (36% on day 1 and 33% at week 4) compared with the fluticasone/salmeterol group (18% each) (P < or = .01). Improvements in peak expiratory flow rate and albuterol rescue-free days were significantly greater with fluticasone/salmeterol vs fluticasone over weeks 1 to 4 (P < or = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the improvements in other measures of asthma control, long-term fluticasone/salmeterol therapy also provided protection against exercise-induced bronchospasm in patients with persistent asthma. <EV> <t> Budesonide/formoterol improves lung function compared with budesonide alone in children with asthma. <abs> UNLABELLED: We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort) with budesonide alone (Pulmicort) or budesonide (Pulmicort) and formoterol (Oxis) administered via separate inhalers in children with asthma. In a 12 wk, double-blind study, a total of 630 children with asthma (mean age 8 yr [4-11 yr]; mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) 92% predicted; mean inhaled corticosteroid dose 454 microg/day) were randomized to: budesonide/formoterol (80/4.5 microg, two inhalations twice daily); a corresponding dose of budesonide alone (100 microg, two inhalations twice daily); or a corresponding dose of budesonide (100 microg, two inhalations twice daily) and formoterol (4.5 microg, two inhalations twice daily) (budesonide + formoterol in separate inhalers). The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline to treatment (average of the 12-wk treatment period) in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF). Other changes in lung function and asthma symptoms were assessed, as was safety. Budesonide/formoterol significantly improved morning PEF, evening PEF and FEV(1) compared with budesonide (all p < 0.001); there was no significant difference between budesonide/formoterol and budesonide + formoterol in separate inhalers for these variables. All other diary card variables improved from baseline in all treatment groups; there were no significant between-group differences. Adverse-event profiles were similar in all groups; there were no serious asthma-related adverse events in any treatment group.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Zoledronic acid significantly reduces skeletal complications compared with placebo in Japanese women with bone metastases from breast cancer: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. <abs> PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid for the treatment of bone metastases from breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with bone metastases (N = 228) were randomly assigned to receive 4 mg zoledronic acid (n = 114) or placebo (n = 114) via 15-minute infusions every 4 weeks for 1 year. The primary efficacy end point was the skeletal-related event (SRE) rate ratio between treatment groups. An SRE was defined as pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, and radiation or surgery to bone. Secondary end points included percentage of patients with at least one SRE, time-to-first SRE, and Andersen-Gill multiple-event analysis. RESULTS: The SRE rate ratio at 1 year (excluding HCM and adjusted for prior fracture) was 0.61 (permutation test; P = .027), indicating that zoledronic acid reduced the rate of SRE by 39% compared with placebo. The percentage of patients with at least one SRE (excluding HCM) was significantly reduced by 20% by zoledronic acid (29.8% v 49.6% for placebo; P = .003). Zoledronic acid significantly delayed time-to-first SRE (median not reached v 364 days; Cox regression; P = .007) and reduced the risk of SREs by 41% in multiple event analysis (risk ratio = 0.59; P = .019) compared with placebo. Zoledronic acid was well tolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo. No patient treated with zoledronic acid had grade 3 or 4 serum creatinine increase. CONCLUSION: Zoledronic acid significantly reduced skeletal complications compared with placebo across multiple end points in Japanese women with bone metastases from breast cancer. <EV> <t> Extended efficacy and safety of denosumab in breast cancer patients with bone metastases not receiving prior bisphosphonate therapy. <abs> PURPOSE: Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL, suppresses bone resorption. This study evaluated the effects of denosumab in i.v. bisphosphonate (IV BP)-naive patients with breast cancer-related bone metastases. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eligible women (n = 255), stratified by type of antineoplastic therapy, were randomized to 1 of 5 blinded denosumab cohorts or an open-label IV BP cohort. Denosumab was administered s.c. every 4 weeks (30, 120, or 180 mg) or every 12 weeks (60 or 180 mg) through 21 weeks. Final efficacy results for up to 25 weeks are reported, including percentage change from baseline in urine N-telopeptide corrected for creatinine (uNTx/Cr) and incidence of skeletal-related events (SRE). Safety results are reported through the end of follow-up (up to 57 weeks). RESULTS: At week 13 and 25, the median percent changes in uNTx/creatinine (Cr) among patients with measurable uNTx were -73% and -75% for the pooled denosumab groups and -79% and -71% for the IV BP group. Among patients with > or =1 postbaseline measurement of uNTx at week 25, 52% (109 of 208) of denosumab-treated patients and 46% (19 of 41) of IV BP-treated patients achieved >65% uNTx/Cr reduction. On-study SREs occurred in 12% (26 of 211) of denosumab-treated patients and 16% (7 of 43) of IV BP-treated patients. Overall rates of adverse events were 95% in denosumab and IV BP groups. No denosumab-related serious or fatal adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In IV BP-naive breast cancer patients with bone metastases, denosumab suppresses bone turnover and seems to reduce SRE risk similarly to IV BPs, with a safety profile consistent with an advanced cancer population receiving systemic therapy. <EV> <t> Endocrine therapy plus zoledronic acid in premenopausal breast cancer. <abs> BACKGROUND: Ovarian suppression plus tamoxifen is a standard adjuvant treatment in premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors are superior to tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients, and preclinical data suggest that zoledronic acid has antitumor properties. METHODS: We examined the effect of adding zoledronic acid to a combination of either goserelin and tamoxifen or goserelin and anastrozole in premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer. We randomly assigned 1803 patients to receive goserelin (3.6 mg given subcutaneously every 28 days) plus tamoxifen (20 mg per day given orally) or anastrozole (1 mg per day given orally) with or without zoledronic acid (4 mg given intravenously every 6 months) for 3 years. The primary end point was disease-free survival; recurrence-free survival and overall survival were secondary end points. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 47.8 months, 137 events had occurred, with disease-free survival rates of 92.8% in the tamoxifen group, 92.0% in the anastrozole group, 90.8% in the group that received endocrine therapy alone, and 94.0% in the group that received endocrine therapy with zoledronic acid. There was no significant difference in disease-free survival between the anastrozole and tamoxifen groups (hazard ratio for disease progression in the anastrozole group, 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.53; P=0.59). The addition of zoledronic acid to endocrine therapy, as compared with endocrine therapy without zoledronic acid, resulted in an absolute reduction of 3.2 percentage points and a relative reduction of 36% in the risk of disease progression (hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.91; P=0.01); the addition of zoledronic acid did not significantly reduce the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.32 to 1.11; P=0.11). Adverse events were consistent with known drug-safety profiles. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of zoledronic acid to adjuvant endocrine therapy improves disease-free survival in premenopausal patients with estrogen-responsive early breast cancer. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00295646.) <EV> <t> Zoledronic acid prevents bone loss in premenopausal women undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer. <abs> PURPOSE: Adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer (BC) may be associated with increased rates of bone loss and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and may lead to premature osteoporosis and increased fracture risk. We examined whether zoledronic acid (ZA) prevents bone loss in premenopausal women receiving chemotherapy for early-stage BC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase III trial comparing ZA (4 mg intravenously every 3 months) versus placebo for 1 year. Premenopausal women underwent serial BMD measurements before initiating chemotherapy and at 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome was percent change in lumbar spine (LS) BMD at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were percent change at any BMD site and markers of bone turnover at 12 months. Linear mixed model analysis for repeated measures was performed. RESULTS: Of 101 women who were randomly assigned and completed baseline evaluation, 96 completed the 6-month evaluation, and 85 completed the 12-month evaluation. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. Mean age was 42 years. Placebo was associated with significant decline in LS BMD at both 6 (2.4%) and 12 (4.1%) months. Similarly, total hip BMD declined by 0.8% at 6 months and 2.6% at 12 months. In contrast, BMD remained stable in ZA patients (P < .0001 compared with placebo). CONCLUSION: Premenopausal women receiving chemotherapy for BC sustained significant bone loss at the LS and hip, whereas BMD remained stable in women who received ZA. Administration of ZA during the first year of chemotherapy is an effective and well-tolerated strategy for preventing bone loss. <EV> <t> Randomized phase II trial of denosumab in patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer, breast cancer, or other neoplasms after intravenous bisphosphonates. <abs> PURPOSE: Patients with bone metastases and elevated urinary N-telopeptide (uNTx), representing excessive bone resorption, are at increased risk for skeletal-related events (SREs), cancer progression, and death. Osteoclast-mediated bone resorption is regulated by RANKL. We evaluated the effect of denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL, in patients with bone metastases and elevated uNTx levels despite ongoing intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate (BP) therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had histologically confirmed malignancy, > or = 1 bone metastases, and uNTx levels higher than 50 nmol/L bone collagen equivalents (BCE)/mM creatinine despite IV BPs. They were stratified by tumor type and screening uNTx levels (50 to 100 or > 100 nmol/L BCE/mM creatinine), and randomly assigned to continue IV BPs every 4 weeks or receive subcutaneous denosumab 180 mg every 4 weeks or every 12 weeks. RESULTS: Among 111 patients accrued, the primary end point of uNTx levels lower than 50 nmol/L BCE/mM creatinine (uNTx < 50) at week 13 was achieved by 49 (71%) of 69 patients in the denosumab arms, compared with 10 (29%) of 35 patients in the IV BP arm (P < .001). The proportion of patients with uNTx lower than 50 was maintained at week 25 (64% denosumab arms; 37% IV BP arm; P = .01). The incidence of SREs was six (8%) of 73 and six (17%) of 35 in the denosumab group and IV BP group, respectively. Rates of adverse events were similar between treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Among patients with elevated uNTx despite ongoing IV BP therapy, denosumab normalized uNTx levels more frequently than the continuation of IV BP. Fewer patients receiving denosumab experienced on-study SREs than those receiving IV BPs. <EV> <t> Denosumab compared with zoledronic acid for the treatment of bone metastases in patients with advanced breast cancer: a randomized, double-blind study. <abs> PURPOSE: This randomized study compared denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) ligand, with zoledronic acid in delaying or preventing skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with breast cancer with bone metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg and intravenous placebo (n = 1,026) or intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg adjusted for creatinine clearance and subcutaneous placebo (n = 1,020) every 4 weeks. All patients were strongly recommended to take daily calcium and vitamin D supplements. The primary end point was time to first on-study SRE (defined as pathologic fracture, radiation or surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression). RESULTS: Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying time to first on-study SRE (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.95; P = .01 superiority) and time to first and subsequent (multiple) on-study SREs (rate ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.89; P = .001). Reduction in bone turnover markers was greater with denosumab. Overall survival, disease progression, and rates of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were similar between groups. An excess of renal AEs and acute-phase reactions occurred with zoledronic acid; hypocalcemia occurred more frequently with denosumab. Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred infrequently (2.0%, denosumab; 1.4%, zoledronic acid; P = .39). CONCLUSION: Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying or preventing SREs in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone and was generally well tolerated. With the convenience of a subcutaneous injection and no requirement for renal monitoring, denosumab represents a potential treatment option for patients with bone metastases. <EV> <t> Ibandronate is effective in preventing skeletal events in patients with bone metastases from colorectal cancer. <abs> Patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (CRC) often develop bone metastases with a high risk of complications. Ibandronate is a novel single-nitrogen bisphosphonate that has been shown to be effective for treating bone metastases from breast cancer. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibandronate in patients with bone metastases from CRC. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients with skeletal-related events (defined as pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation therapy to bone, change in antineoplastic therapy or surgery to bone). Secondary end points included time to first skeletal event, skeletal morbidity rate (events/year) and time to progression of bone lesions. In 73 patients with CRC, treatment with intravenous ibandronate 6 mg administered via a 15-min infusion significantly reduced the proportion of patients with skeletal events (39% vs. 78% with placebo; P = 0.019) and prolonged the time to first event by at least 6 months (median >279 vs. 93 days with placebo; P = 0.009). Ibandronate also significantly reduced the skeletal morbidity rate (mean 2.36 vs. 3.14 with placebo; P = 0.018) and prolonged time to progression of bone lesions (214 days vs. 81 days with placebo; P = 0.018). Ibandronate was well tolerated with very rare grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Furthermore, the incidence of renal adverse events was comparable with placebo and there were no clinically relevant changes in serum creatinine. Ibandronate provided significant clinical benefits for patients with bone metastases secondary to CRC. These results indicate that ibandronate may be an effective treatment for patients with metastatic bone disease following CRC. Larger studies are required for further assessment. <EV> <t> Bisphosphonate treatment in primary breast cancer: results from a randomised comparison of oral pamidronate versus no pamidronate in patients with primary breast cancer. <abs> PURPOSE AND PATIENTS: During the period from January 1990 to January 1996 a total of 953 patients with lymph node negative primary breast cancer were randomised to oral pamidronate (n=460) 150 mg twice daily for 4 years or no adjuvant pamidronate (n=493) in order to investigate whether oral pamidronate can prevent the occurrence of bone metastases and fractures. The patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, loco-regional radiation therapy, but no endocrine treatment. RESULTS: During the follow-up period the number of patients with pure bone metastases was 35 in the control group and 31 in the pamidronate group. The number of patients with a combination of bone and other distant metastases were 22 in the control group and 20 in the pamidronate group. The hazard rate ratio for recurrence in bone in the pamidronate group compared to the control group was 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.75-1.40) and p=0.86. No effect was observed on overall survival. In a small subgroup of 27 patients from the study, 12 of whom were treated with pamidronate a significant bone preserving effect was observed on bone mineral density in the lumbar spine, but not in the proximal femur. CONCLUSION: The results from the trial do not support a beneficial effect of oral pamidronate on the occurrence of bone metastases or fractures in patients with primary breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. <EV> <t> Efficacy of zoledronic acid in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer receiving adjuvant letrozole: 36-month results of the ZO-FAST Study. <abs> BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are accepted as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women (PMW) with hormone-responsive early breast cancer (EBC) with superior efficacy to tamoxifen. However, increased bone loss is associated with AIs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PMW with EBC receiving letrozole (2.5 mg/day for 5 years) were randomly assigned to immediate zoledronic acid (ZOL; 4 mg every 6 months) or delayed ZOL (initiated only for fracture or high risk thereof). RESULTS: Patients (N = 1065) had a median age of 58 years; 54% had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy. At 36 months, mean change in L2-L4 bone mineral density (BMD) was +4.39% for immediate versus -4.9% for delayed ZOL (P < 0.0001). Between-group differences were 5.27% at 12 months, 7.94% at 24 months, and 9.29% at 36 months (P < 0.0001 for all). At 36 months, the immediate-ZOL group had a significant 41% relative risk reduction for disease-free survival (DFS) events (P = 0.0314). Adverse events are consistent with the known safety profiles of the study drugs. CONCLUSIONS: At 36 months, immediate ZOL was more effective in preserving BMD during letrozole therapy. Immediate versus delayed ZOL led to significantly improved DFS. Benefits are observed in the context of a favorable, well-established safety profile for letrozole and ZOL. <EV> <t> Effect of zoledronic acid on disseminated tumour cells in women with locally advanced breast cancer: an open label, randomised, phase 2 trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Treatment with bisphosphonates decreases bone loss and can increase disease-free survival in patients with breast cancer. The aim of our study was to assess the effect of zoledronic acid on clearance of disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) from the bone marrow in women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. METHODS: Patients were recruited for this open-label, phase 2 randomised trial between March 17, 2003, and May 19, 2006, at a single centre. Eligible patients had clinical stage II-III (> or = T2 and/or > or = N1) newly diagnosed breast cancer, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and normal cardiac, renal, and liver function. 120 women were randomly assigned, using allocation concealment, to receive 4 mg zoledronic acid intravenously every 3 weeks (n=60), or no zoledronic acid (n=60), for 1 year concomitant with four cycles of neoadjuvant epirubicin (75 mg/m(2)) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) and two cycles of adjuvant epirubicin plus docetaxel. The primary endpoint was the number of patients with detectable DTCs at 3 months. Final analysis was done 1 year after the last patient was enrolled. Analyses were done for all patients with available data at 3 months. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00242203. FINDINGS: Of the 120 patients initially enrolled, one withdrew after signing consent and one patient's baseline bone marrow was not available. Both of these patients were in the control group. At 3 months, 109 bone-marrow samples were available for analysis. In the zoledronic acid group, bone marrow was not collected from one patient because of disease progression, one patient was taken off study because of severe diarrhoea, and two patients had not consented at the time of surgery. In the control group, bone marrow was not collected from two patients because of disease progression, one patient withdrew consent, and three patients were not consented at the time of surgery. At baseline, DTCs were detected in 26 of 60 patients in the zoledronic acid group and 28 of 58 patients in the control group. At 3 months, 17 of 56 patients receiving zoledronic acid versus 25 of 53 patients who did not receive zoledronic acid had detectable DTCs (p=0.054). The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were infection (five of 60 patients in the zoledronic acid group and six of 59 in the control group) and thrombosis (five of 60 in the zoledronic acid and two of 59 in the control group). There was one documented case of osteonecrosis in the zoledronic acid group. INTERPRETATION: Zoledronic acid administered with chemotherapy resulted in a decreased proportion of patients with DTCs detected in the bone marrow at the time of surgery. Our study supports the hypothesis that the antimetastatic effects of zoledronic acid may be through effects on DTCs.

The ongoing Zometa-Femara Adjuvant Synergy Trial (Z-FAST) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in preventing such bone loss. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter study, postmenopausal women with early hormone receptor-positive breast cancer receiving adjuvant letrozole were randomized to receive up-front or delayed-start zoledronic acid (ZA; 4 mg intravenously every 6 months) for 5 years. Delayed-start ZA was administered if the lumbar spine (LS) or total hip (TH) T score fell below -2.0 or a nontraumatic fracture occurred. The primary endpoint was to compare the change from baseline in LS bone mineral density (BMD) between groups at month 12; secondary endpoints, measured at other predetermined timepoints, included comparing changes in TH BMD, LS BMD, and markers of bone turnover, fracture incidence, and time to disease recurrence. Herein, we report the results of the 36-month interim analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 301 patients were randomized to each group. At month 36, the absolute difference in mean LS and TH BMDs between the up-front and delayed groups was 6.7% and 5.2%, respectively (P < .0001 for both). Although this study was not designed to show antifracture efficacy, the incidence of fractures was slightly higher in the delayed group (up-front, 17 [5.7%] vs. delayed, 19 [6.3%]) but not statistically significant (P = .8638). Pyrexia (27 [9%] vs. 6 [2%]; P = .0002) and bone pain (39 [13%] vs. 20 [6.7%]; P = .01) were more common in up-front patients; cough (13 [4.3%] vs. 27 [9%]; P = .03) was more common in delayed patients. No severe renal dysfunction or confirmed cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw were reported. Disease recurrence was reported in 9 up-front (3.0%) and 16 delayed (5.3%) patients (Kaplan-Meier analysis, P = .127), with an absolute decrease of 2.3%.

METHODS: From January to December 1999, a sample of 42 preterm infants, with birthweight < 2,000 g, mechanically ventilated in the first week of life, were randomly divided, in the beginning of the weaning process, into two groups according to the position: supine position (n = 21) or prone position (n = 21). Heart rate, respiratory rate, transcutaneous oxygen saturation and ventilatory parameters were recorded every one hour. Length of the weaning process and complications were also assessed. RESULTS: In both groups the mean gestational age was 29 weeks, most of the patients presented very low birthweight and respiratory distress syndrome. The mean length of the weaning process was 2 days. There were no differences between the groups regarding respiratory rate, heart rate and transcutaneous oxygen saturation, however, oxygen desaturation episodes were more frequent in supine position (p = 0.009).

{"document": "<EV> <t> Neuropsychological change in early phase schizophrenia during 12 months of treatment with olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol. The Canadian Collaborative Group for research in schizophrenia. <abs> BACKGROUND: The purpose of this investigation was to test the efficacy of novel antipsychotic medications in the treatment of cognitive impairment in early phase schizophrenia. METHODS: Sixty-five patients in this multicenter double-blind study were randomly assigned to olanzapine (5-20 mg), risperidone (4-10 mg), or haloperidol (5-20 mg). Standard measures of clinical and motor syndromes were administered, as well as a comprehensive battery of tests to assess (1) motor skills, (2) attention span, (3) verbal fluency and reasoning, (4) nonverbal fluency and construction, (5) executive skills, and (6) immediate recall at baseline and after 6, 30, and 54 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: The general cognitive index derived from the 6 domain scores revealed a significantly greater benefit from treatment with olanzapine relative to haloperidol and olanzapine relative to risperidone, but no significant difference was shown between risperidone and haloperidol. The improvement related to olanzapine was apparent after 6 weeks and enhanced after 30 and 54 weeks of treatment. Exploratory within-group analyses of the 6 cognitive domains after a conservative Bonferroni adjustment revealed a significant improvement with olanzapine only on the immediate recall domain, and similar analyses of the 17 individual tests revealed a significant improvement with olanzapine only on the Hooper Visual Organization Test. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that olanzapine has some superior cognitive benefits relative to haloperidol and risperidone. A larger sample replication study is necessary to confirm and generalize the observations of this study and begin evaluation of the implications of this change to cerebral function and quality of life for people with schizophrenia. <EV> <t> Risperidone versus haloperidol in psychotic patients with disturbing neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms: a double-blind, multi-center trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: A randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial was started to compare the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) during risperidone and haloperidol treatment in schizophrenic patients who had disturbing EPS during their previous neuroleptic treatment. Additional objectives of this trial were comparing the antipsychotic effectiveness of the two treatments and the use of antiparkinsonian medication. METHODS: Effects of flexible doses of risperidone and haloperidol were compared in 77 psychotic patients (83% with chronic schizophrenia) with disturbing neuroleptic-induced EPS (risperidone 40 patients, haloperidol 37). The trial was completed by 47 patients: 25 in the risperidone group (12 women, 13 men), and 22 in the haloperidol group (10 women, 12 men). RESULTS: An adequate antipsychotic effect was obtained in most patients by both treatments. The primary aim of this trial was comparing parkinsonism measured with the extrapyramidal syndrome rating scale (ESRS) during treatment with risperidone and haloperidol. Two primary parameters were selected: the change from baseline to the worst score during treatment of ESRS II (parkinsonism) and ESRS VI (clinical global impression of severity of parkinsonism). The CGI of severity of parkinsonism was better with risperidone (P=0.025), while the parkinsonism total score tended to be better with risperidone (P<0. 10). Before the double-blind treatment, 34 (of the 77) had used antiparkinson medication (risperidone 18, haloperidol 16). During the double-blind treatment phase, 21 patients had used antiparkinson medication (risperidone 11, haloperidol 10). The larger reduction of parkinsonism in the risperidone group was not due to a difference in the use of anti-parkinsonian medication. CONCLUSIONS: In this group of schizophrenic patients with disturbing EPS during previous neuroleptic treatment, a stronger reduction of parkinsonism was observed with risperidone than with haloperidol. <EV> <t> Effects of atypical neuroleptics on sustained attention deficits in schizophrenia: a trial of risperidone versus haloperidol. <abs> To help determine whether sustained attention deficits as measured with the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) are stable vulnerability indicators of schizophrenia, we compared the CPT performance of schizophrenic patients before and after treatment with risperidone or haloperidol. In this double blind trial, 56 schizophrenic patients were randomly assigned to a 12-week regimen of either risperidone or haloperidol, after a 1-week washout period. The patients undertook two sessions of the CPT (undegraded and 25% degraded) twice, one at the end of the washout period and the other at the end of the study. Thirty-eight patients completed the study, 19 in each group. Both groups experienced significant improvements in clinical symptoms, and the risperidone group showed no change in the severity of extrapyramidal symptoms. Despite those improvements, the CPT performance indexes did not change significantly from the beginning to the end of the study. These findings indicate that sustained attention deficits might be stable vulnerability indicators of schizophrenia. <EV> <t> A comparison of risperidone and haloperidol for the prevention of relapse in patients with schizophrenia. <abs> BACKGROUND: Prevention of relapse is a major goal of maintenance treatment in patients with psychotic disorders. We performed a long-term comparison of a newer, atypical antipsychotic drug, risperidone, and an older, conventional neuroleptic drug, haloperidol, in terms of the rate of relapse in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. METHODS: In a double-blind, prospective study at 40 sites, we randomly assigned adult outpatients in stable condition with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to receive treatment with flexible doses of either risperidone or haloperidol for a minimum of one year. RESULTS: Of the 397 patients who underwent randomization, data from 2 were excluded because they did not receive study medication; data from all 30 patients from one site were excluded by the sponsor, the Janssen Research Foundation, because of concern about the integrity of the data. The median duration of treatment was 364 days in the risperidone group and 238 days in the haloperidol group (P=0.02). Of the 177 patients assigned to risperidone and the 188 assigned to haloperidol who remained in the analysis, 44.1 percent and 52.7 percent, respectively, discontinued treatment for reasons other than relapse. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the risk of relapse at the end of the study was 34 percent for the risperidone group and 60 percent for the haloperidol group (P<0.001); the risk ratio for relapse with haloperidol, from the Cox model, was 1.93 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.33 to 2.80; P<0.001). Early discontinuation of treatment for any reason was more frequent among haloperidol-treated patients (risk ratio, 1.52; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.18 to 1.96). Patients in the risperidone group had greater reductions in the mean severity of both psychotic symptoms and extrapyramidal side effects than those in the haloperidol group.

Thirty patients with mitochondrial cytopathy received 1200 mg/day CoQ(10) for 60 days in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial. Blood lactate, urinary markers of oxidative stress, body composition, activities of daily living, quality of life, forearm handgrip strength and oxygen desaturation, cycle exercise cardiorespiratory variables, and brain metabolites were measured.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of a combination therapy (creatine monohydrate, coenzyme Q(10), and lipoic acid to target the above-mentioned cellular consequences) on several outcome variables using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study design in patients with mitochondrial cytopathies. Three patients had mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), four had mitochondrial DNA deletions (three patients with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and one with Kearns-Sayre syndrome), and nine had a variety of other mitochondrial diseases not falling into the two former groups. The combination therapy resulted in lower resting plasma lactate and urinary 8-isoprostanes, as well as attenuation of the decline in peak ankle dorsiflexion strength in all patient groups, whereas higher fat-free mass was observed only in the MELAS group. Together, these results suggest that combination therapies targeting multiple final common pathways of mitochondrial dysfunction favorably influence surrogate markers of cellular energy dysfunction. Future studies with larger sample sizes in relatively homogeneous groups will be required to determine whether such combination therapies influence function and quality of life. <EV> <t> Controlled clinical trial of dichloroacetate for treatment of congenital lactic acidosis in children. <abs> OBJECTIVE: Open-label studies indicate that oral dichloroacetate (DCA) may be effective in treating patients with congenital lactic acidosis. We tested this hypothesis by conducting the first double-blind, randomized, control trial of DCA in this disease. METHODS: Forty-three patients who ranged in age from 0.9 to 19 years were enrolled. All patients had persistent or intermittent hyperlactatemia, and most had severe psychomotor delay. Eleven patients had pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, 25 patients had 1 or more defects in enzymes of the respiratory chain, and 7 patients had a mutation in mitochondrial DNA. Patients were preconditioned on placebo for 6 months and then were randomly assigned to receive an additional 6 months of placebo or DCA, at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg every 12 hours. The primary outcome results were (1) a Global Assessment of Treatment Efficacy, which incorporated tests of neuromuscular and behavioral function and quality of life; (2) linear growth; (3) blood lactate concentration in the fasted state and after a carbohydrate meal; (4) frequency and severity of intercurrent illnesses and hospitalizations; and (5) safety, including tests of liver and peripheral nerve function. OUTCOME: There were no significant differences in Global Assessment of Treatment Efficacy scores, linear growth, or the frequency or severity of intercurrent illnesses. DCA significantly decreased the rise in blood lactate caused by carbohydrate feeding. Chronic DCA administration was associated with a fall in plasma clearance of the drug and with a rise in the urinary excretion of the tyrosine catabolite maleylacetone and the heme precursor delta-aminolevulinate. CONCLUSIONS: In this highly heterogeneous population of children with congenital lactic acidosis, oral DCA for 6 months was well tolerated and blunted the postprandial increase in circulating lactate. However, it did not improve neurologic or other measures of clinical outcome. <EV> <t> Oxidative stress biomarkers in mitochondrial myopathies, basally and after cysteine donor supplementation. <abs> Mitochondrial diseases are due to impairment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. A plausible pathogenic mechanism leading to cellular dysfunction and phenotypic expression is oxidative stress, but there are surprisingly few clinical studies on this subject. Glutathione (GSH) deficiency has been reported in mitochondrial diseases, and the biosynthesis of glutathione depends on cysteine availability. We have examined oxidative stress biomarkers [advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)] in blood samples from 27 patients and 42 controls. AOPP levels were greater in patients than in controls (P value <0.00001). Therefore, we performed a double-blind cross-over study to evaluate if 30-day supplementation with a whey-based cysteine donor could modify these markers, reduce lactate concentration during aerobic exercise, or enhance muscular strength and quality of life. Treatment did not modify lactate concentration, clinical scale (MRC) or quality of life (SF-36), but significantly reduced oxidative stress levels. Our findings reinforce the notions that in mitochondrial diseases oxidative stress is important and can be reduced by administration of a cysteine donor. Oxidative stress biomarkers may be useful to detect redox imbalance in mitochondrial diseases and to provide non-invasive tools to monitor disease status. <EV> <t> Dichloroacetate causes toxic neuropathy in MELAS: a randomized, controlled clinical trial. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of dichloroacetate (DCA) in the treatment of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). BACKGROUND: High levels of ventricular lactate, the brain spectroscopic signature of MELAS, correlate with more severe neurologic impairment. The authors hypothesized that chronic cerebral lactic acidosis exacerbates neuronal injury in MELAS and therefore, investigated DCA, a potent lactate-lowering agent, as potential treatment for MELAS. METHODS: The authors conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 3-year cross-over trial of DCA (25 mg/kg/day) in 30 patients (aged 10 to 60 years) with MELAS and the A3243G mutation. Primary outcome measure was a Global Assessment of Treatment Efficacy (GATE) score based on a health-related event inventory, and on neurologic, neuropsychological, and daily living functioning. Biologic outcome measures included venous, CSF, and 1H MRSI-estimated brain lactate. Blood tests and nerve conduction studies were performed to monitor safety. RESULTS: During the initial 24-month treatment period, 15 of 15 patients randomized to DCA were taken off study medication, compared to 4 of 15 patients randomized to placebo. Study medication was discontinued in 17 of 19 patients because of onset or worsening of peripheral neuropathy. The clinical trial was terminated early because of peripheral nerve toxicity. The mean GATE score was not significantly different between treatment arms. CONCLUSION: DCA at 25 mg/kg/day is associated with peripheral nerve toxicity resulting in a high rate of medication discontinuation and early study termination. Under these experimental conditions, the authors were unable to detect any beneficial effect. The findings show that DCA-associated neuropathy overshadows the assessment of any potential benefit in MELAS.", "summary:reference": "Despite identifying eight new trials there is currently no clear evidence supporting the use of any intervention in mitochondrial disorders.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Comparison of hypertonic saline and alternate-day or daily recombinant human deoxyribonuclease in children with cystic fibrosis: a randomised trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Daily recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) is an established but expensive treatment in cystic fibrosis. Alternate-day treatment, if equally effective, would reduce the drug cost. Hypertonic saline improved lung function to the same degree as rhDNase in short-term studies. We compared the effectiveness of daily rhDNase, hypertonic saline, and alternate-day rhDNase in children with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: In an open cross-over trial, 48 children were allocated in random order to 12 weeks of once-daily rhDNase (2.5 mg), alternate-day rhDNase (2.5 mg), and twice-daily 5 mL 7% hypertonic saline. The primary outcome was forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)). Secondary outcomes were forced vital capacity, number of pulmonary exacerbations, weight gain, quality of life, exercise tolerance, and the total costs of hospital and community care. FINDINGS: Mean FEV(1) increased by 16% (SD 25%), 14% (22%), and 3% (21%) with daily rhDNase, alternate-day rhDNase, and hypertonic saline, respectively. There was no difference between daily and alternate-day rhDNase (2% [95% CI -4 to 9], p=0.55). However, daily rhDNase showed a significantly greater increase in FEV(1) than hypertonic saline (8% [2 to 14], p=0.01). The average difference in 12-week cost between daily and alternate-day rhDNase was pound513 (95% CI -546 to 1510) and that between daily rhDNase and hypertonic saline was pound1409 (440 to 2318). None of the secondary clinical outcomes showed significant differences between treatments.

ORACLE Collaborative Group. <abs> BACKGROUND: Preterm, prelabour rupture of the fetal membranes (pPROM) is the commonest antecedent of preterm birth, and can lead to death, neonatal disease, and long-term disability. Previous small trials of antibiotics for pPROM suggested some health benefits for the neonate, but the results were inconclusive. We did a randomised multicentre trial to try to resolve this issue. METHODS: 4826 women with pPROM were randomly assigned 250 mg erythromycin (n=1197), 325 mg co-amoxiclav (250 mg amoxicillin plus 125 mg clavulanic acid; n=1212), both (n=1192), or placebo (n=1225) four times daily for 10 days or until delivery. The primary outcome measure was a composite of neonatal death, chronic lung disease, or major cerebral abnormality on ultrasonography before discharge from hospital. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Two women were lost to follow-up, and there were 15 protocol violations. Among all 2415 infants born to women allocated erythromycin only or placebo, fewer had the primary composite outcome in the erythromycin group (151 of 1190 [12.7%] vs 186 of 1225 [15.2%], p=0.08) than in the placebo group. Among the 2260 singletons in this comparison, significantly fewer had the composite primary outcome in the erythromycin group (125 of 1111 [11.2%] vs 166 of 1149 [14.4%], p=0.02). Co-amoxiclav only and co-amoxiclav plus erythromycin had no benefit over placebo with regard to this outcome in all infants or in singletons only. Use of erythromycin was also associated with prolongation of pregnancy, reductions in neonatal treatment with surfactant, decreases in oxygen dependence at 28 days of age and older, fewer major cerebral abnormalities on ultrasonography before discharge, and fewer positive blood cultures. Although co-amoxiclav only and co-amoxiclav plus erythromycin were associated with prolongation of pregnancy, they were also associated with a significantly higher rate of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis. INTERPRETATION: Erythromycin for women with pPROM is associated with a range of health benefits for the neonate, and thus a probable reduction in childhood disability. However, co-amoxiclav cannot be routinely recommended for pPROM because of its association with neonatal necrotising enterocolitis.

The two groups were similar in age, gender, race, and extent of burn. Procutase is an ionic hydrogel composed of natural hydrophilic polymers in an active ionic solution with an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1, -3 and -9 (collagenase/gelatinase). Subjects were seen in follow-up biweekly, and wounds of patients in SSD group were compared with those of Procutase group for healing time, pain score at dressing change, compliance with therapy and complication rate. The result of this study showed that Procutase treated patients had statistically significantly less pain and shorter wound healing time.

Braun Hospicare Ltd, Collooney Co.

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of Askina Calgitrol Ag((R)) and 1% silver sulfadiazine (1% AgSD) in the outpatient management of partial-thickness burn wounds at Burn Unit, Siriraj Hospital. A prospective descriptive study was conducted between January 2008 and January 2009 in Burn Unit, Division of Trauma Surgery, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Thailand. The 65 patients with partial-thickness burn wounds, less than 24 hours post-burn injury, had a total body surface area (TBSA%) less than 15% were treated at Siriraj Outpatient Burn Clinic. All patients were divided into Askina Calgitrol Ag((R)) treated group (30 patients) and 1% AgSD treated group (35 patients). The data were compared by the demographics including age, gender, % TBSA burn, pain score, number of wound dressing change, nursing time and time of wound healing. Patients included in both groups were comparable with no significant differences in demographic data of age, gender, location of burn and type of burn injury (P > 0.05 evaluated by paired Student's t-test) between both group. The present results showed that average pain scores in the Askina Calgitrol Ag((R)) treated group were significantly lower than the 1% AgSD treated group (2.23 +/- 1.87 versus 6.08 +/- 2.33, respectively) between both groups (P < 0.02). Patients treated with Askina Calgitrol Ag((R)) had significantly lower number of wound dressing change (P < 0.02) and nursing time (P < 0.02) compared with 1% AgSD treated group. The Askina Calgitrol Ag((R)) group needed less frequent wound dressing. Healing time was 7 +/- 3.51 days after the application of Askina Calgitrol Ag((R)). This was significantly shorter than that of control wounds (14 +/- 4.18 days). Application of Askina Calgitrol Ag((R)) leads to a good burn wound outcome.

Pain associated with dressing changes is a common problem in burn wounds. Aquacel Ag, a hydrofiber dressing coated with ionic silver has been reported to reduce burn wound infection and promote antimicrobial activity. The purpose of this study was to show the benefits of Aquacel Ag for the treatment of partial thickness burns. This prospective randomized study was conducted in 70 patients who had partial thickness burns less than 15% of total body surface area and were treated at Siriraj outpatient burn clinic during December 2006-February 2008. Patients were divided into two groups: Aquacel Ag-treated group with dressing changes every 3 days (35 patients) and 1% silver sulfadiazine-treated group, with daily dressing changes (35 patients). There was no difference in demographic data including age, gender, burn percentage between groups. Time-to-wound healing pain score during dressing change and cost of treatment were compared between both groups. Time-to-wound closure was significantly shorter in the Aquacel Ag-treated group (10 +/- 3 versus 13.7 +/- 4 days, P < 0.02) as well as pain scores at days 1, 3 and 7 (4.1 +/- 2.1, 2.1 +/- 1.8, 0.9 +/- 1.4 versus 6.1 +/- 2.3, 5.2 +/- 2.1, 3.3 +/- 1.9, respectively, P < 0.02). Total cost of treatment was 52 +/- 29 US dollars for the Aquacel Ag-treated group versus 93 +/- 36 US dollars for the silver sulfadiazine-treated group.

Anxiety was assessed using 100-mm visual analogue scales (VAS) and The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) psychometric questionnaire. Midazolam premedication did not significantly reduce either VAS or STAI score, although heart rate and systolic arterial pressure immediately before induction of anaesthesia were significantly lower in patients who received midazolam (p = 0.006 and 0.039, respectively). Induction of anaesthesia was achieved with a lower dose of propofol (p = 0.0009) and excellent (Grade I) conditions for insertion of a laryngeal mask airway were achieved more often after midazolam premedication (p = 0.038). Arterial desaturation during induction of anaesthesia and insertion of a laryngeal mask airway occurred more often in patients who received placebo (p = 0.022).

Forty-five outpatients scheduled for gynecological laparoscopic surgery participated in a double-blinded study to compare the effectiveness and side effects of oral alprazolam 0.5 mg with midazolam 7.5 mg, as a reference drug, and placebo. We evaluated psychomotor function by means of the Trieger Dot Test (TDT) and the Digit-Symbol Substitution Test. Simple memory tests were performed. Data were analyzed with chi(2) or paired Student's t-tests, or with one-way analysis of variance with the Student-Newman-Keuls or Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Alprazolam and midazolam both decreased anxiety scores more than placebo (P < 0.05). One hour after premedication, the Digit- Symbol Substitution Test score was similar in all groups, whereas the TDT score was greater (indicating impairment of performance) in the alprazolam group than in the placebo group (P < 0.05). Sedation scores, extubation time, and discharge times in the active drug groups did not differ from placebo. At discharge from the postanesthesia care unit, the TDT score was greater in both active drug groups compared with placebo (P < 0.05). Five patients, exclusively in the midazolam group, had amnesia (P < 0.05). We conclude that alprazolam may be an effective alternative to midazolam for anxiety reduction without causing amnesia. However, it may cause greater impairment of psychomotor function in the early postoperative period.

Meta-analyses of trials of intravenous immune globulin for suspected or proven neonatal sepsis suggest a reduced rate of death from any cause, but the trials have been small and have varied in quality. METHODS: At 113 hospitals in nine countries, we enrolled 3493 infants receiving antibiotics for suspected or proven serious infection and randomly assigned them to receive two infusions of either polyvalent IgG immune globulin (at a dose of 500 mg per kilogram of body weight) or matching placebo 48 hours apart.

{"document": "<EV> <t> The influence of mild hypothermia on ICP, CPP and outcome in patients with primary and secondary brain injury. <abs> Aim of this study was to examine the hypothesis that only a subgroup of patients with lesser primary brain damage after severe head injury may benefit from therapeutic hypothermia. We prospectively analysed 72 patients with severe head injury, randomized into groups with (n = 37) and without (n = 35) hypothermia of 34 degrees C maintained for 72 hours. The influence of hypothermia on ICP, CPP and neurological outcome was analysed in the context of the extent of primary brain damage. Patients with normothermia and primary lesions (n = 17) values: GCS on admission 5 (median), ICP 18.9 (mean), CPP 73 (mean), GOS 4 (median). Patients with normothermia and extracerebral hematomas (n = 20): GCS 4, ICP 16, CPP 71, GOS 3. Patients with hypothermia and primary lesions (n = 21): GCS 4,62, ICP 10, 81, CPP 78,1, GOS 4. Patients with hypothermia and extracerebral hematomas (n = 14): GCS 5, ICP 13.2, CPP 78, GOS 5. Hypothermia decreased ICP and increased CPP regardless of the type of brain injury. Hypothermia was not able to improve outcome in patients with primary brain lesions but this pilot study suggests that it significantly improves outcome in patients with extracerebral hematomas. <EV> <t> Phase II clinical trial of moderate hypothermia after severe traumatic brain injury in children. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To determine whether moderate hypothermia (HYPO) (32-33 degrees C) begun in the early period after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and maintained for 48 hours is safe compared with normothermia (NORM) (36.5-37.5 degrees C). METHODS: After severe (Glasgow Coma Scale score < or =8) nonpenetrating TBI, 48 children less than 13 years of age admitted within 6 hours of injury were randomized after stratification by age to moderate HYPO (32-33 degrees C) treatment in conjunction with standardized head injury management versus NORM in a multicenter trial. An additional 27 patients were entered into a parallel single-institution trial of excluded patients because of late transfer or consent (delayed in transfer >6 h but within 24 h of admission), unknown time of injury (e.g., child abuse), and adolescence (e.g., aged 13-18 yr). Assessments of safety included mortality, infection, coagulopathy, arrhythmias, and hemorrhage as well as ability to maintain target temperature, mean intracranial pressure (ICP), and percent time of ICP less than 20 mm Hg during the cooling and subsequent rewarming phases. Additionally, assessments of neurocognitive outcomes were obtained at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Moderate HYPO after severe TBI in children was found to be safe relative to standard management and NORM in children of all ages and in children with delay of initiation of treatment up to 24 hours. Although there was decreased mortality in HYPO in both studies, there was an increased potential for arrhythmias with HYPO, although they were manageable with fluid administration or rewarming. Additionally, there was a reduction in mean ICP during the first 72 hours after injury in both studies, although rebound ICP elevations in HYPO compared with those in NORM were noted for up to 10 to 12 hours after rewarming. Although functional outcome at 3 or 6 months did not differ between treatment groups, functional outcome tended to improve from the 3- to 6-month cognitive assessment in HYPO compared with NORM, although the sample size was too small for any definitive conclusions. CONCLUSION: HYPO is likely a safe therapeutic intervention for children after severe TBI up to 24 hours after injury. Further studies are necessary and warranted to determine its effect on functional outcome and intracranial hypertension. <EV> <t> Effects of therapeutic mild hypothermia on patients with severe traumatic brain injury after craniotomy. <abs> PURPOSE: We investigated the effects of therapeutic mild hypothermia on patients with severe traumatic brain injury after craniotomy (TBI). METHODS: Eighty patients with severe TBI after unilateral craniotomy were randomized into a therapeutic hypothermia group with the brain temperature maintained at 33 degrees C to 35 degrees C for 4 days, and a normothermia control group in the intensive care unit. Vital signs, intracranial pressure, serum superoxide dismutase level, Glasgow Outcome Scale scores, and complications were prospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The mean intracranial pressure values of the therapeutic hypothermia group at 24, 48, and 72 hours after injury were much lower than those of the control group (23.49 +/- 2.38, 24.68 +/- 1.71, and 22.51 +/- 2.44 vs 25.87 +/- 2.18, 25.90 +/- 1.86, and 24.57 +/- 3.95 mm Hg; P = .000, .000, and .003, respectively). The mean serum superoxide dismutase levels of the therapeutic hypothermia group at days 3 and 7 were much higher than those of the control group at the same time point (533.0 +/- 103.4 and 600.5 +/- 82.9 vs 458.7 +/- 68.1 and 497.0 +/- 57.3 mug/L, respectively; P = .000). The percentage of favorable neurologic outcome 1 year after injury was 70.0% and 47.5%, respectively (P = .041). Complications, including pulmonary infections (57.5% in the therapeutic hypothermia group vs 32.5% in the control group; P = .025) were managed without severe sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic mild hypothermia provides a promising way in the intensive care unit for patients with severe TBI after craniotomy. <EV> <t> Hypothermia therapy after traumatic brain injury in children. <abs> BACKGROUND: Hypothermia therapy improves survival and the neurologic outcome in animal models of traumatic brain injury. However, the effect of hypothermia therapy on the neurologic outcome and mortality among children who have severe traumatic brain injury is unknown. METHODS: In a multicenter, international trial, we randomly assigned children with severe traumatic brain injury to either hypothermia therapy (32.5 degrees C for 24 hours) initiated within 8 hours after injury or to normothermia (37.0 degrees C). The primary outcome was the proportion of children who had an unfavorable outcome (i.e., severe disability, persistent vegetative state, or death), as assessed on the basis of the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score at 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 225 children were randomly assigned to the hypothermia group or the normothermia group; the mean temperatures achieved in the two groups were 33.1+/-1.2 degrees C and 36.9+/-0.5 degrees C, respectively. At 6 months, 31% of the patients in the hypothermia group, as compared with 22% of the patients in the normothermia group, had an unfavorable outcome (relative risk, 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89 to 2.22; P=0.14). There were 23 deaths (21%) in the hypothermia group and 14 deaths (12%) in the normothermia group (relative risk, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.90 to 2.27; P=0.06). There was more hypotension (P=0.047) and more vasoactive agents were administered (P<0.001) in the hypothermia group during the rewarming period than in the normothermia group. Lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and in the hospital and other adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In children with severe traumatic brain injury, hypothermia therapy that is initiated within 8 hours after injury and continued for 24 hours does not improve the neurologic outcome and may increase mortality.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Recanalization of cervical artery dissection: influencing factors and role in neurological outcome. <abs> BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Generally, the prognosis for cervical artery dissection (CAD) is uncertain. The recanalization rate of CAD can be up to 85% within 3 months. This study evaluates the variables that might affect recanalization and the role of recanalization as a predictor for neurological outcome. PATIENTS AND RESULTS: This study prospectively included 38 patients with acute stroke following occlusion due to CAD (18 males, 20 females, median age 50.5 years, range 16-82). Vertebral and carotid dissections were equally distributed (19 carotid dissections). The recanalization rate was influenced by the presence of hypertension (p = 0.001). Outcomes were dependent on infarct location. Patients with lateral medullary infarction returned to functional independence (p = 0.026), while patients with deep hemispheric infarction tended to have a disabling stroke (p = 0.068). The presence of good collaterals seemed to influence functional independence (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: There seemed to be no relationship between outcome and the rate of recanalization following CAD. Recanalization appeared to be a spontaneous mechanism, which could have depended on the intrinsic condition of the vessels. Finally, neurological outcome was dependent on lesion localization and the presence of good collaterals. <EV> <t> Dissection of cervical arteries: Long-term follow-up study of 130 consecutive cases. <abs> BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We describe the natural history, functional prognosis and long-term recurrences of patients with dissection of cervical arteries (DCA) in a sequential observational study. METHODS: We describe 130 patients with angiographically-proven DCA admitted to the Neurology Institute in Mexico City (Mexico), and analyzed clinical and neuroimaging data, treatment and outcome. Treatment with either anticoagulation or aspirin was decided by the primary physician. Primary outcome measures were recurrence (stroke and death) and clinical outcome at 6 months. Follow-up studies were performed to determine recanalization. RESULTS: Mean age was 35.4 years; 4 patients died (3%) and 126 were followed for 3,906 person/years; 17 patients (13%) had a heralding ischemic cerebral event (6 strokes, 11 TIAS) about 8 days before the diagnosis of DCA. After diagnosis, recurrent ischemic stroke occurred in 6 patients (4.8%) within the 2 first weeks (1.5 persons/1,000 follow-up years). No significant differences were found between aspirin and anticoagulation. Recanalization was more frequent in vertebral dissections. Complete recanalization of vertebral dissections was associated with a favorable prognosis [OR 3.2 (95% CI 1.1-8.8; p = 0.02)]. CONCLUSIONS: In Mexico, DCA affects young adults and may present with a heralding stroke or TIA. We found rare, early ischemic recurrences. Vertebral territory dissections had better prognosis than carotid ones, particularly in patients with demonstrated complete recanalization. <EV> <t> Aspirin vs anticoagulation in carotid artery dissection: a study of 298 patients. <abs> BACKGROUND: No randomized study has yet compared efficacy and safety of aspirin and anticoagulants in patients with spontaneous dissection of the cervical carotid artery (sICAD). METHODS: Prospectively collected data from 298 consecutive patients with sICAD (56% men; mean age 46 +/- 10 years) treated with anticoagulants alone (n = 202) or aspirin alone (n = 96) were retrospectively analyzed. Admission diagnosis was ischemic stroke in 165, TIA in 37, retinal ischemia in 8, and local symptoms and signs (headache, neck pain, Horner syndrome, cranial nerve palsy) in 80 patients, while 8 patients were asymptomatic. Clinical follow-up was obtained after 3 months by neurologic examination (97% of patients) or structured telephone interview. Outcome measures were 1) new cerebral ischemic events, defined as ischemic stroke, TIA, or retinal ischemia, 2) symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and 3) major extracranial bleeding. RESULTS: During follow-up, ischemic events were rare (ischemic stroke, 0.3%; TIA, 3.4%; retinal ischemia, 1%); their frequency did not significantly differ between patients treated with anticoagulants (5.9%) and those treated with aspirin (2.1%). The same was true for hemorrhagic adverse events (anticoagulants, 2%; aspirin, 1%). New ischemic events were significantly more frequent in patients with ischemic events at onset (6.2%) than in patients with local symptoms or asymptomatic patients (1.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of a nonrandomized study, our data suggest that frequency of new cerebral and retinal ischemic events in patients with spontaneous dissection of the cervical carotid artery is low and probably independent of the type of antithrombotic treatment (aspirin or anticoagulants). <EV> <t> Risk of stroke and recurrent dissection after a cervical artery dissection: a multicenter study. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of stroke, TIA, or dissection recurrence after a first event of cervical artery dissection (CAD). METHODS: The authors undertook a historical cohort study of consecutive patients with a first event of CAD who were admitted in 24 departments of neurology within a period of at least 1 year. Patients were retrospectively selected from a stroke data bank or from the local administrative data bank using the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases. A neurologist and a radiologist reviewed all charts to validate diagnosis and collect data. In 2002, patients were interviewed by phone or during a visit by the local investigators. RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-nine patients (mean age 44.0 +/- 9.7 years) were included in the study. Among the 457 survivors, 25 (5.5%) could not be contacted in 2002 because they had moved. After a mean follow-up of 31 months, four (0.9%) patients presented a recurrent ischemic stroke attributable to either not yet completely recovered initial CAD (n = 2) or a recurrent CAD (n = 2). Eight (1.8%) patients had a TIA without CAD recurrence. Two TIA occurred at the acute stage of CAD. Of the six remaining TIA, only one was associated with chronic arterial stenosis. In addition, two patients had recurrent CAD without stroke, giving a total of four (0.9%) CAD recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a first event of CAD have a very low risk of ischemic events or dissection recurrences. Ischemic events seem rarely to be in relation with chronic arterial lesions. <EV> <t> [Spontaneous carotid and vertebral arteries dissection in a multiethnic population]. <abs> Spontaneous dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries (SDCVA) is considered a rare cause of stroke, particularly in countries with multiethnic population. The objective was to evaluate the clinical and neuroimaging features of patients with SDCVA from a multiethnic population. Sixty-six patients diagnosed with SDCVA were studied at two tertiary hospitals at Sao Paulo. An initial questionnaire was completed and patients were followed prospectively. Among the patients studied, 82% were caucasian, 53% were male and the average age was 41.7 years old. The most frequent cardiovascular risk factors found were systemic hypertension and tobacco use. Other aspects evaluated were history of previous migraine, initial treatment and prognosis. In conclusion, although the population studied was multiethnic, there was a marked predominance of caucasians. The analysis of clinical and neuroimaging data from patients with SDCVA allows a better understanding of the disease, leading to an earlier diagnosis and more appropriate treatment. <EV> <t> Cervical artery dissection--clinical features, risk factors, therapy and outcome in 126 patients. <abs> The highly variable clinical course of cervical artery dissections still poses a major challenge to the treating physician. This study was conducted (1) to describe the differences in clinical and angiographic presentation of patients with carotid and vertebral artery dissections (CAD, VAD), (2) to define the circumstances that are related to bilateral arterial dissections, and (3) to determine factors that predict a poor outcome. Retrospectively and by standardised interview, we studied 126 patients with cervical artery dissections. Preceding traumata, vascular risk factors, presenting local and ischemic symptoms, and patient-outcome were evaluated. Patients with CAD presented more often with a partial Horner's syndrome and had a higher prevalence of fibromuscular dysplasia than patients with VAD. Patients with VAD complained more often of neck pain, more frequently reported a preceding chiropractic manipulation and had a higher incidence of bilateral dissections than patients with CAD. Bilateral VAD was significantly related to a preceding chiropractic manipulation. Multivariate analysis showed that the variables stroke and arterial occlusion were the only independent factors associated with a poor outcome. This study emphasises the potential dangers of chiropractic manipulation of the cervical spine. Probably owing to the systematic use of forceful neck-rotation to both sides, this treatment was significantly associated with bilateral VAD. Patients with dissection-related cervical artery occlusion had a significantly increased risk of suffering a disabling stroke. <EV> <t> Primary headaches and painful spontaneous cervical artery dissection. <abs> The relation between primary headaches (PH) and pain related to spontaneous cervical artery dissection (SCAD) is still unclear, as well as the progress of PH after dissection. To investigate this relation, the characteristics of pain related to SCAD and changes in PH patterns after SCAD, we evaluated 54 consecutive patients. Thirty-five (65%) had previous PH. Painful SCAD occurred in 39 (72%). Frontal and parietal localizations were significantly associated with internal carotid artery dissection (p=0.013 and p=0.010, respectively), whereas occipital and nuchal pain, with vertebral artery dissection (p=0.047 and p<0.001, respectively). Previous PH did not influence the presence of pain at SCAD onset. Twenty-six (74%) patients with PH reported improvement in PH pattern after a mean follow-up of 32 months. These results suggest that mechanisms underlying PH do not modulate dissection-related pain. Disruption of perivascular afferents may be involved in improvement of PH patterns after SCAD. <EV> <t> Adult cervicocerebral artery dissection: a single-center study of 301 Finnish patients. <abs> BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There are only few small studies assessing potential risk factors, comorbidity, and prognostic factors in adult spontaneous cervicocerebral artery dissection (CAD). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, hospital-based analysis on the prognostic factors and association of CAD with vascular risk factors in 301 consecutive Finnish patients, diagnosed from 1994 to 2007. RESULTS: Two thirds of the patients were men (68%). Women were younger than men. Migraine (36% of all patients), especially with visual aura (63% of all migraineurs), and smoking were more common in patients with CAD compared with the general Finnish population. At 3 months, 247 (83%) patients reached a favorable outcome. Occlusion of the dissected artery, internal carotid artery dissection (ICAD), and recent infection in infarction patients were associated with a poorer outcome. ICAD patients had less often brain infarction, but the strokes they had were more severe. Seven (2.3%) patients died during the follow-up (mean 4.0 years, 1186 patient years). Six (2%) patients had verified CAD recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for the association of CAD with male sex, and possible association with smoking and migraine.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Bupropion and cognitive-behavioral treatment for depression in smoking cessation. <abs> This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial examining the effects of an intensive cognitive-behavioral mood management treatment (CBTD) and of bupropion, both singularly and in combination, on smoking cessation in adult smokers. As an extension of our previous work, we planned to examine the synergistic effects of CBTD and bupropion on smoking cessation outcomes in general and among smokers with depression vulnerability factors. Participants were 524 smokers (47.5% female, M (age) = 44.27 years) who were randomized to one of four 12-week treatments: (a) standard, cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation treatment (ST) plus bupropion (BUP), (b) ST plus placebo (PLAC), (c) standard cessation treatment combined with cognitive-behavioral treatment for depression (CBTD) plus BUP, and (d) CBTD plus PLAC. Follow-up assessments were conducted 2, 6, and 12 months after treatment, and self-reported abstinence was verified biochemically. Consistent with previous studies, bupropion, in comparison with placebo, resulted in better smoking outcomes in both intensive group treatments. Adding CBTD to standard intensive group treatment did not result in improved smoking cessation outcomes. In addition, neither CBTD nor bupropion, either alone or in combination, was differentially effective for smokers with single-past-episode major depressive disorder (MDD), recurrent MDD, or elevated depressive symptoms. However, findings with regard to recurrent MDD and elevated depressive symptoms should be interpreted with caution given the low rate of recurrent MDD and the low level of depressive symptoms in our sample. An a priori test of treatment effects in smokers with these depression vulnerability factors is warranted in future clinical trials. <EV> <t> Nortriptyline plus nicotine replacement versus placebo plus nicotine replacement for smoking cessation: pragmatic randomised controlled trial. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of nortriptyline plus nicotine replacement therapy compared with placebo plus nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation. DESIGN: Pragmatic randomised controlled trial. SETTING: National Health Service stop smoking service clinics. PARTICIPANTS: 901 people trying to stop smoking. INTERVENTIONS: Participants chose their nicotine replacement product, including combinations of nicotine replacement therapy, and received behavioural support. Nortriptyline was started one to two weeks before quit day, with the dose increased from 25 mg to 75 mg daily for eight weeks and reduced if not tolerated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was prolonged confirmed abstinence at six months. Secondary outcomes were prolonged abstinence at 12 months, drug use, severity of side effects, nicotine withdrawal symptoms, and urges to smoke. RESULTS: 72 of 445 (16%) people using nortriptyline and 55 of 456 (12%) using placebo achieved prolonged abstinence at six months (relative risk 1.34, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.86). At 12 months the corresponding values were 49 (11%) for nortriptyline and 40 (9%) for placebo (1.26, 0.84 to 1.87). 337 (79%) people in the nortriptyline arm and 325 (75%) in the placebo arm were taking combination treatment on quit day, median 75 mg per day in both groups. More people in the nortriptyline arm than in the placebo arm took lower doses. The nortriptyline arm had noticeably higher severity ratings for dry mouth and constipation than the placebo arm, with slightly higher ratings for sweating and feeling shaky. Both groups had similar urges to smoke, but nortriptyline reduced depression and anxiety. Overall, withdrawal symptom scores did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: Nortriptyline and nicotine replacement therapy are both effective for smoking cessation but the effect of the combination is less than either alone and evidence is lacking that combination treatment is more effective than either alone. Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN57852484. <EV> <t> Randomized comparison of a nicotine inhaler and bupropion for smoking cessation and relapse prevention. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To compare the combination of a nicotine inhaler and bupropion to either treatment alone for initiating smoking abstinence and relapse prevention. METHODS: Smokers were randomized to receive a nicotine inhaler, bupropion, or both for 3 months. At 3 months, smoking-abstinent study participants were randomized to their initial medications or placebo. Participants who were smoking at 3 months were randomized to an alternative treatment regimen or placebo. This study was conducted from July 2001 to January 2003. RESULTS: A total of 1700 smokers were randomized to treatment (phase 1) for 3 months. Among the 941 study participants eligible for randomization to the phase 2 trial, 837 continued in the study. For the phase 2 trial, 405 smoking-abstinent participants were randomized to relapse prevention for 9 additional months, and 432 smokers were randomized to re-treatment for an additional 3 months. At the end of the initial 3 months of treatment (phase 1), 82 (14%) of 566, 145 (26%) of 567, and 194 (34%) of 567 study participants receiving a nicotine inhaler, bupropion, or both, respectively, were abstinent from smoking. Of the 405 smoking-abstinent participants at the end of 3 months, the bupropion group had more smokers than the placebo group (mean No. of smokers, 1.5 vs 1.1; P < .001), and the nicotine inhaler group had higher smoking abstinence rates at 12 months than the placebo group. Those receiving combination therapy had reduced rates of relapse to smoking for the first 3 months of relapse prevention, but this difference disappeared after the initial 3 months. Of the 432 study participants who were smoking at the end of 3 months and who received an alternative treatment regimen, the 223 smokers initially assigned to a nicotine inhaler were more likely to stop smoking at 6 months if they were re-treated with bupropion instead of placebo (8 [7%] of 111 vs 0 [0%] of 112; P = .003), and the 209 smokers initially treated with bupropion and re-treated with a nicotine inhaler did not have significantly higher smoking abstinence rates (6 [6%] of 104 vs 3 [3%] of 105; P = -.50). CONCLUSION: Combined therapy with a nicotine inhaler and bupropion increased smoking abstinence rates. Continuation of the initial combination therapy does not appear to prevent relapse to smoking. Timing of re-treatment and alternative approaches to relapse prevention should be further examined. <EV> <t> A randomized controlled clinical trial of bupropion SR and individual smoking cessation counseling. <abs> Efficacy of bupropion SR and individual counseling as smoking cessation treatments was assessed in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial among adult daily smokers. Bupropion SR treatment and counseling were fully crossed in this factorial design so that the efficacy of each treatment and the combination could be estimated, relative to a placebo medication and assessment control condition. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that bupropion SR increased abstinence rates at the end of treatment, relative to the placebo medication conditions, for both biochemically confirmed 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (OR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.04-3.72) and self-reported prolonged abstinence (OR = 2.90, 95% CI 1.66-5.06). Bupropion SR treatment also improved latency to lapse and relapse and improved the latency between lapse and relapse in survival analyses. Medication effects were more modest for both 12-month point-prevalence abstinence (OR = 1.47, 95% CI 0.74-2.92) and prolonged abstinence (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 0.66-2.72). Counseling was not associated with increases in the likelihood of abstinence at any time point (odds ratios ranged from 0.80 to 1.16 across abstinence outcomes in the full intent-to-treat sample). Counseling and medication did not significantly interact at any time point, and adding counseling did not improve end-of-treatment point-prevalence abstinence (OR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.68-2.03) or prolonged abstinence (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 0.75-2.12) substantially when offered in conjunction with active medication. <EV> <t> A 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study of bupropion sr added to high-dose dual nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation or reduction in schizophrenia. <abs> The objective of this study was to examine whether there is a benefit of adding bupropion SR to high-dose combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and weekly group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking reduction or cessation in schizophrenia. Fifty-one adult smokers with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to a 12-week trial of bupropion SR 300 mg/d or placebo added to transdermal nicotine patch, nicotine polacrilex gum, and CBT. The treatment goal was smoking cessation. The primary outcome measure was biochemically confirmed 7-day point-prevalence of 50% to 100% smoking reduction at week 12. Secondary outcomes were biochemically confirmed tobacco abstinence and change from baseline in expired air carbon monoxide (CO) and psychiatric symptoms. Subjects on bupropion + NRT had a greater rate of 50% to 100% smoking reduction at weeks 12 (60% vs. 31%; P = 0.036) and 24, a lower expired air CO in the treatment and follow-up periods, (F = 13.8; P < 0.001) and a greater continuous abstinence rate at week 8, before NRT taper, (52% vs. 19%; P = 0.014). However, relapse rates in subjects on bupropion + dual NRT were 31% during NRT taper (weeks 8-12) and 77% at the 12-month follow-up. Abstinence rates did not differ by treatment group at weeks 12 (36% vs. 19%), 24 (20% vs. 8%), or 52 (12% vs. 8%). Because abstinence rates were high during treatment with combination pharmacotherapy and relapse rates were very high during taper and after discontinuation of treatment, study of longer term treatment with combination pharmacotherapy and CBT for sustained abstinence is warranted in those who attain initial abstinence with this intervention. <EV> <t> A placebo-controlled trial of bupropion combined with nicotine patch for smoking cessation in schizophrenia. <abs> BACKGROUND: Individuals with schizophrenia smoke at higher rates (58%-88%) than the general population (approximately 22%), and have difficulty quitting. We determined whether the combination of sustained-release (SR) bupropion (BUP) with the transdermal nicotine patch (TNP) was well-tolerated and superior to placebo (PLO)+TNP for smoking cessation in schizophrenia. METHODS: A 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of BUP (300 mg/day) in combination with TNP (21 mg/24h) for 58 outpatient smokers with schizophrenia was conducted. Primary outcome measures were continuous smoking abstinence in the last 4 weeks of the trial (Days 43-70) and 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 months post-target quit date (TQD) (week 26). RESULTS: Smokers assigned to the BUP+TNP group (n = 29) were more likely to achieve continuous smoking abstinence (8/29, 27.6%) than the PLO+TNP group (n = 29, 1/29, 3.4%) [Fisher's Exact Test, p < .05]; at 6-months post-TQD, 4/29 (13.8%) versus 0/29 (0.0%) achieved 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence (p = .11). Neither bupropion SR nor smoking abstinence significantly altered the positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The combination was well-tolerated in smokers with schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with bupropion SR+TNP versus placebo+TNP is well-tolerated and significantly improved short-term smoking abstinence in smokers with schizophrenia. <EV> <t> A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of bupropion for smoking cessation in primary care. <abs> BACKGROUND: Studies undertaken in academic settings have shown that bupropion hydrochloride can double the odds of smoking cessation compared with placebo. To assess whether these results are applicable in primary care, we launched a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to be conducted by general practitioners. METHODS: We assigned 593 healthy smokers to receive bupropion hydrochloride, 150 mg twice a day, or placebo daily for 7 weeks (hereinafter, bupropion group [n = 400] and placebo group [n = 193], respectively). After the baseline visit, 4 clinical visits and 3 telephone calls were scheduled over the 1-year period. The primary end points were biochemically confirmed continuous abstinence at week 7 and at week 52. RESULTS: Seventy-one Italian general practitioners enrolled participants from April 2004 to May 2005. Of the bupropion group, 41.0% were continuously abstinent from week 4 to week 7 compared with 22.3% of the placebo group (multivariate odds ratio, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.60-3.53). The continuous abstinence rates from week 4 to week 52 were 25% in the bupropion group and 14% in the placebo group (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-3.39). The mean weight gain was similar in both groups and among long-term abstainers was 3 kg in women and 4 kg in men. More participants in the bupropion group experienced an adverse event than those in the placebo group, but the percentage who discontinued use of the study medication was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Bupropion more than doubled the odds of continuous abstinence from smoking. The adherence of general practitioners and participants to the protocol was excellent, making our findings robust and easy to generalize to the context of primary care. <EV> <t> Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 2 dosages of sustained-release bupropion for adolescent smoking cessation. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride for adolescent smoking cessation. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial. SETTING: Metropolitan areas of Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents (N = 312) recruited through media and various community venues from March 1, 1999, through December 31, 2002, who were aged 14 to 17 years, smoked 6 or more cigarettes per day, had an exhaled carbon monoxide level of 10 ppm or greater, had at least 2 previous quit attempts, and had no other current major psychiatric diagnosis. INTERVENTION: Sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride, 150 mg/d (n = 105) or 300 mg/d (n = 104), or placebo (n = 103) for 6 weeks, plus weekly brief individual counseling. Subjects were followed up at 12 weeks (by telephone call) and 26 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 weeks and 30-day prolonged abstinence (carbon monoxide level < 10 ppm at each visit; urinary cotinine level < or = 50 microg/L at weeks 2 and 6). RESULTS: Cotinine-confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates at 6 weeks were as follows: placebo, 5.6%; 150 mg, 10.7%; and 300 mg, 14.5% (P = .03, 300 mg vs placebo). At 26 weeks, confirmed point prevalence abstinence rates were as follows: placebo, 10.3%; 150 mg, 3.1%; and 300 mg, 13.9% (P = .049). During treatment, confirmed point prevalence rates were significantly higher for 300 mg than placebo at every week except week 4. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride, 300 mg/d, plus brief counseling demonstrated short-term efficacy for adolescent smoking cessation. Abstinence rates were lower than those reported for adults, with rapid relapse after medication discontinuation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00344695. <EV> <t> Bupropion and nicotine patch as smoking cessation aids in alcoholics. <abs> This is a double-blind placebo-controlled study of sustained-release bupropion as a smoking cessation aid in alcoholics undergoing treatment for their alcoholism. Participants (N=58) were enrolled within 1 week of entry into alcohol treatment from community and Veterans Affairs Substance Use Disorder programs. All participants received nicotine patch and were invited to attend a smoking cessation lecture and group. Cigarette smoking and alcohol outcomes were measured at 6 months. Bupropion when added to nicotine patch did not improve smoking outcomes. One third of participants on bupropion reported discontinuing the drug during weeks 1-4. Participants reported cigarette outcomes with nicotine patch that are similar to those seen in the general population. All study participants significantly reduced cigarette use. Comorbid affective disorder or antipersonality disorder did not affect outcomes. Alcohol outcomes were improved in those who discontinued cigarettes. <EV> <t> A randomized trial of bupropion and/or nicotine gum as maintenance treatment for preventing smoking relapse. <abs> AIM: To investigate the efficacy of maintenance treatment with bupropion and/or nicotine gum for reducing smoking relapse. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A 48-week study was conducted at a university-based smoking cessation clinic between February 2001 and October 2005. A total of 588 smokers received bupropion and nicotine patch in 8 weeks of open-label treatment (OLT); 289 abstainers during the last 4 weeks of OLT were randomized in double-blind placebo-controlled fashion to one of four arms for 16 weeks of maintenance treatment (MT) followed by 24 weeks of non-treatment follow-up (NTFU). INTERVENTION: Bupropion (300 mg/day) and 2 mg nicotine gum, used alone or combined, and comparable placebo pill and placebo gum. Behavioral counseling at all visits. OUTCOME: Time to relapse (TTR) from randomization. Relapse is defined as the first 7 consecutive days of smoking. Abstinence verified by carbon monoxide <or= 8 parts per million. FINDINGS: TTR was longer with extended active treatments compared to placebo (median days to relapse: bupropion + placebo = 136, nicotine + placebo = 98, bupropion + nicotine = 90, double placebo = 71). Hazard ratios (HR) for relapse were statistically significant for bupropion + placebo versus double placebo during MT (HR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37-0.92) and to the end of NTFU (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.42-0.96). However, bupropion's advantage dissipated upon stopping the drug. Gum use was low, preventing a valid assessment; but analysis restricted to gum users suggested a weak effect of extended nicotine gum. CONCLUSION: Maintenance treatment with bupropion exerted a modest benefit for preventing smoking relapse; the optimum duration of bupropion treatment was unclear. Further research is needed to ascertain the merits of extended use of nicotine gum, other nicotine replacement agents and other treatments known to aid smokers for preventing relapse once abstinence is achieved. <EV> <t> Efficacy of bupropion alone and in combination with nicotine gum. <abs> In this double-blind, placebo-controlled smoking cessation treatment study, 608 participants were randomly assigned to receive active bupropion and active 4-mg gum (AA, n = 228), active bupropion and placebo gum (AP, n = 224), or placebo bupropion and placebo gum (PP, n = 156). Relative to the PP group, the AA and AP groups were each significantly more likely to be abstinent at 1 week, end of treatment, and 6 months but not at 12 months postquit. After the first week postquit there were no differences in abstinence rates between the AA and AP groups. We found no significant individual difference variables that moderated outcome beyond 1 week postquit. <EV> <t> Bupropion and cognitive-behavioral therapy for smoking cessation in women. <abs> Gender data for bupropion suggest that it may be a particularly effective smoking cessation medication for women. It is not known whether the efficacy of this pharmacotherapy differs as a function of the psychotherapy with which it is administered. This study used a two level factorial design to examine the independent and interactive effects of medication (bupropion 300 mg/day vs. placebo) and psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT] vs. supportive therapy [ST]). In addition to testing the hypothesis that bupropion with CBT would be most effective of all the treatments, we examined medication compliance and its role in the efficacy of bupropion. Participants were 154 women, aged at least 30 years and smoking more than 10 cigarettes/day. Compliance with study medication was assessed using Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS) over 7 weeks of treatment. Psychological interventions were delivered in 60-min weekly group sessions. Longitudinal analysis of abstinence outcomes from end of treatment (EOT) through 12 months after treatment revealed a significant interaction of medication and therapy. Higher abstinence rates at EOT and 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups were observed when bupropion was delivered concurrently with CBT (44%, 24%, 30%, 23%, 17%) rather than with ST (18%, 1%, 8%, 5%, 2%). The bupropion-CBT combination, however, was not clearly superior to placebo, regardless of therapy assignment. Higher rates of medication compliance were positively predictive of abstinence, and this effect was most evident in the placebo condition. Findings provide only modest support for CBT as the preferred type of intensive therapy in conjunction with bupropion in women. <EV> <t> Sustained-release bupropion for hospital-based smoking cessation: a randomized trial. <abs> INTRODUCTION: Bupropion is a first-line pharmacological aid for smoking cessation; however, no clinical trials have been conducted in a general population of hospitalized smokers. METHODS: We enrolled 85 smokers in a hospital-based randomized smoking cessation trial conducted at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. A total of 42 participants received a 7-week course of sustained-release bupropion and 43 participants received placebo. All participants received cognitive-behavioral counseling. We screened 14,997 patients, of whom 25% were current smokers. Of the 536 smokers who met the entry criteria, 451 opted not to enroll. We determined on-medication, end-of-medication, 3-month, and 6-month smoking cessation rates. RESULTS: At the end of 7 weeks of drug treatment, self-reported quit rates were equivalent in the bupropion and placebo arms, 37% versus 33%, respectively (p = .82). The validated quit rates for the bupropion and placebo groups were 27% versus 29%, respectively (p = 1.00). At 6 months, the self-reported quit rates were 29% in the bupropion group and 41% in the placebo group (p = .36). In a comparison of 6-month quit rates, validated either by salivary cotinine or by spousal proxy, we found nonsignificantly higher quit rates in the placebo group than in the bupropion group, 31% versus 15% (p = .12). DISCUSSION: The addition of sustained-release bupropion to counseling did not increase quit rates, but the study was underpowered. Because of the secular trend toward shorter hospital stays, recruitment was very difficult, raising questions regarding the feasibility of future hospital-based smoking cessation trials and interventions. <EV> <t> Fluoxetine, smoking, and history of major depression: A randomized controlled trial. <abs> The study was a randomized placebo-controlled trial testing whether fluoxetine selectively enhances cessation for smokers with a history of depression. Euthymic smokers with (H+, n = 109) or without (H-, n = 138) a history of major depression received 60 mg fluoxetine or placebo plus group behavioral quit-smoking treatment for 12 weeks. Fluoxetine initially enhanced cessation for H+ smokers (p = .02) but subsequently impaired cessation regardless of depressive history. Six months after quit date, fluoxetine-treated participants were 3.3 times more likely to be smoking (p = .02). Further research is warranted to determine why high-dose fluoxetine produces continuing effects that oppose tobacco abstinence. <EV> <t> A randomized trial of smoking cessation. Medication versus motivation. <abs> OBJECTIVE: A prospective randomized study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness and side effect profiles of nicotine patch and bupropion therapies for smoking cessation. METHODS: Three hundred and fifty patients were referred to our smoking cessation program in the Department of Pulmonary Diseases, Gaziantep University between September 2002 and July 2003. Of these, only 131 patients fulfilled the trial criteria. We randomized the patients into nicotine patch (n=50), bupropion (n=50) and control groups (n=31). Cases were followed up for 24 weeks. Questionnaires including the Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence and Beck Depression Inventory were carried out at initial evaluation. Declaration of quitting and exhaled carbon monoxide level less than 10 ppm was accepted as success criteria. RESULTS: Success rates were 26% for nicotine patch group, 26% for bupropion and 16% for control group at the end of the 24th week (p=0.56). Beck depression inventory scores did not differ significantly between the groups, however none of the cases with scores greater than 13 succeeded regardless of the group. Mean body weight at baseline and change at 6 months did not differ significantly between the groups. Sleep disturbance was significantly more common in nicotine patch and bupropion groups than the control group (p=0.008). CONCLUSION: The present study reinforces the role of medical doctors and importance of close follow up in smoking cessation, and directed counseling is quite as effective as pharmacologic therapy and is the sole approach without any adverse effects.", "summary:reference": "The antidepressants bupropion and nortriptyline aid long-term smoking cessation.

DESIGN: Phase III, Single centre, open, randomised, comparative, parallel group study. SETTING: District General Hospital in the United Kingdom. POPULATION: Fifty-one women with objective menorrhagia. METHODS: Twenty-five women randomised to receive the LNG IUS and 26 to oral mefenamic acid for six cycles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change from baseline in menstrual blood loss (MBL), total menstrual fluid loss (TMFL) and pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) score at the third and sixth cycle of treatment. RESULTS: After six cycles the median menstrual blood loss was 5 mL in the LNG IUS group and 100 mL in the mefenamic acid group (P < 0.001). Median TMFL was 27 mL in the LNG IUS group and 157 mL in the mefenamic acid group (P < 0.001). Median PBAC score was 25 in the LNG IUS group and 159 in the mefenamic acid group. Changes in menstrual blood loss correlated strongly to changes in TMFL (r= 0.88) but PBAC correlated less well to blood loss and total fluid loss (r= 0.53 and r= 0.58).

{"document": "<EV> <t> Cognitive-behavioral treatment of persistent functional somatic complaints and pediatric anxiety: an initial controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents who seek medical treatment for persistent physical distress often suffer from co-occurring anxiety disorders. Treatment options for this impaired population are limited. This study tests the feasibility and potential efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral intervention targeting pain and anxiety for youth with impairing functional physical symptoms and anxiety disorders presenting to pediatricians for medical care. METHODS: Children and adolescents (aged 8-16) experiencing somatic complaints, without an explanatory medical disorder (i.e., functional), were recruited from primary care and specialty (gastroenterologists and cardiologists) pediatricians. Forty children, primarily with gastrointestinal symptoms, who met criteria for a co-occurring anxiety disorder, were randomly assigned to a cognitive-behavioral treatment addressing pain and anxiety, Treatment of Anxiety and Physical Symptoms (TAPS), or to a waiting list control. RESULTS: TAPS was found to be an acceptable treatment for this population and was superior to the waiting list condition. Eighty percent of children in TAPS were rated as treatment responders by independent evaluators compared with none of the controls. Overall, self- and parent ratings indicated reductions in children's somatic discomfort and anxiety following intervention. TAPS participants maintained clinical gains 3 months following treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The study supports the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral intervention targeting co-occurring physical distress and anxiety in youth presenting for medical treatment. Such an approach has the potential to exert broad impact on children's dysfunction and to minimize exposure to invasive, ineffective, and costly medical procedures and treatments. <EV> <t> Cognitive-behavioral treatment versus an active control for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders: a randomized trial. <abs> OBJECTIVE: The current trial examined whether a specific cognitive-behavioral treatment package was more efficacious in treating childhood anxiety disorders than a nonspecific support package. METHOD: One hundred twelve children (aged 7-16 years) with a principal anxiety disorder were randomly allocated to either a group cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) program or a control condition (group support and attention [GSA]). RESULTS: Overall, results showed that CBT was significantly more efficacious compared with the GSA condition: 68.6% of children in the CBT condition did not meet diagnostic criteria for their principal anxiety diagnosis at 6-month follow-up compared with 45.5% of the children in the GSA condition. The results of the child- and parent-completed measures indicated that, although mothers of CBT children reported significantly greater treatment gains than mothers of GSA children, children reported similar improvements across conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Specific delivery of cognitive-behavioral skills is more efficacious in the treatment of childhood anxiety than a treatment that includes only nonspecific therapy factors. <EV> <t> Treating anxiety disorders in children with high functioning autism spectrum disorders: a controlled trial. <abs> A family-based, cognitive behavioural treatment for anxiety in 47 children with comorbid anxiety disorders and High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (HFA) was evaluated. Treatment involved 12 weekly group sessions and was compared with a waiting list condition. Changes between pre- and post-treatment were examined using clinical interviews as well as child-, parent- and teacher-report measures. Following treatment, 71.4% of the treated participants no longer fulfilled diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder. Comparisons between the two conditions indicated significant reductions in anxiety symptoms as measured by self-report, parent report and teacher report. Discussion focuses on the implications for the use of cognitive behaviour therapy with HFA children, for theory of mind research and for further research on the treatment components. <EV> <t> Group cognitive behavior therapy for children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders and anxiety: a randomized trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are at high risk for developing significant anxiety. Anxiety can adversely impact functioning across school, home and community environments. Cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) are frequently used with success for children with anxiety symptoms. Modified CBT interventions for anxiety in children with ASD have also yielded promising results. METHODS: Fifty children with high-functioning ASD and anxiety were randomizedto group CBT or treatment-as-usual (TAU) for 12 weeks. Independent clinical evaluators, blind to condition, completed structured interviews (Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule - Parent Version;ADIS-P) pre- and post-intervention condition. RESULTS: Forty-seven children completed either the CBT or TAU condition. Results indicated markedly better outcomes for the CBT group. Significant differences by group were noted in Clinician Severity Ratings, diagnostic status, and clinician ratings of global improvement. In the intent-to-treat sample, 10 of 20 children (50%) in the CBT group had a clinically meaningful positive treatment response, compared to 2 of 23 children (8.7%) in the TAU group. CONCLUSIONS: Initial results from this randomized, designed treatment study suggest that agroup CBT intervention specifically developed for children with ASD may be effective in decreasing anxiety. Limitations of this study include small sample size, lack of an attention control group, and use of outcome measures normed with typically developing children <EV> <t> Effectiveness of group cognitive-behavioral treatment for childhood anxiety in community clinics. <abs> This study evaluated the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral treatment for childhood anxiety in a community clinic setting in Hong Kong, China. Forty-five clinically-referred children (age 6-11 years) were randomly assigned to either a cognitive-behavioral treatment program or a waitlist-control condition. Children in the treatment condition showed significant reduction in anxiety symptoms-both statistically and clinically-whereas children in the waitlist condition did not. After the waitlist period was over, the control group also received the treatment program and showed a similar reduction in symptoms. For the full sample of 45 children, the effectiveness of the intervention was significant immediately after treatment and in 3- and 6-month follow-ups. In addition, children's anxiety cognition and their ability to cope with anxiety-provoking situations fully mediated the treatment gains. These results offer empirical support for cognitive-behavioral treatment programs in a non-Western cultural context and plausible mediators for how cognitive-behavioral therapy works. <EV> <t> Treating Anxiety Disorders in Inner City Schools: Results from a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing CBT and Usual Care. <abs> BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) in inner city schools, when delivered by novice CBT clinicians, and compared to usual care (UC), is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study addressed this issue by comparing a modular CBT for anxiety disorders to UC in a sample of 32 volunteer youth (mean age 10.28 years, 63% female, 84% African American) seen in school-based mental health programs. METHODS: Youth were randomly assigned to CBT (n = 17) or UC (n = 15); independent evaluators conducted diagnostic interviews with children and parents at pre- and post-intervention, and at a one-month follow-up. RESULTS: Based on intent-to-treat analyses, no differences were found in response rates between groups with 50 and 42% of the children in CBT, compared to 46 and 57% in UC no longer meeting criteria for an anxiety disorder at post-treatment and follow-up respectively. Similar improvements in global functioning were also found in both treatment groups. Baseline predictors of a positive treatment response included lower anxiety, fewer maladaptive thoughts, less exposure to urban hassles, and lower levels of parenting stress. Therapist use of more CBT session structure elements and greater competence in implementing these elements was also related to a positive treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this small pilot failed to show that CBT was superior to UC when delivered by school-based clinicians. Large scale comparative effectiveness trials are needed to determine whether CBT leads to superior clinical outcomes prior to dissemination. <EV> <t> The Coping Cat program for children with anxiety and autism spectrum disorder: a pilot randomized controlled trial. <abs> The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate whether a modified version of the Coping Cat program could be effective in reducing anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Twenty-two children (ages 8-14; IQ >/= 70) with ASD and clinically significant anxiety were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of the Coping Cat program (cognitive-behavioral therapy; CBT) or a 16-week waitlist. Children in the CBT condition evidenced significantly larger reductions in anxiety than those in the waitlist. Treatment gains were largely maintained at two-month follow-up. Results provide preliminary evidence that a modified version of the Coping Cat program may be a feasible and effective program for reducing clinically significant levels of anxiety in children with high-functioning ASD. <EV> <t> Cognitive behavior therapy for generalized social anxiety disorder in adolescents: a randomized controlled trial. <abs> Early identification and treatment of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is critical to prevent development of a chronic course of symptoms, persistent functional impairment, and progressive psychiatric comorbidity. A small but growing literature supports the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders, including SAD, in adolescence. The present randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of group vs. individual CBT for adolescents with generalized SAD in relation to an educational/supportive psychotherapy that did not contain specific CBT elements. All three treatments were associated with significant reductions in symptoms and functional impairment, and in improved social skills. No differences between treatments emerged on measures of symptoms, but the CBT conditions demonstrated greater gains on behavioral measures. The implications of the findings are discussed. <EV> <t> Cognitive behavioral therapy of socially phobic children focusing on cognition: a randomised wait-list control study. <abs> BACKGROUND: Although literature provides support for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as an efficacious intervention for social phobia, more research is needed to improve treatments for children. METHODS: Forty four Caucasian children (ages 8-14) meeting diagnostic criteria of social phobia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; APA, 1994) were randomly allocated to either a newly developed CBT program focusing on cognition according to the model of Clark and Wells (n = 21) or a wait-list control group (n = 23). The primary outcome measure was clinical improvement. Secondary outcomes included improvements in anxiety coping, dysfunctional cognitions, interaction frequency and comorbid symptoms. Outcome measures included child report and clinican completed measures as well as a diagnostic interview. RESULTS: Significant differences between treatment participants (4 dropouts) and controls (2 dropouts) were observed at post test on the German version of the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children. Furthermore, in the treatment group, significantly more children were free of diagnosis than in wait-list group at post-test. Additional child completed and clinician completed measures support the results. DISCUSSION: The study is a first step towards investigating whether CBT focusing on cognition is efficacious in treating children with social phobia. Future research will need to compare this treatment to an active treatment group. There remain the questions of whether the effect of the treatment is specific to the disorder and whether the underlying theoretical model is adequate. CONCLUSION: Preliminary support is provided for the efficacy of the cognitive behavioral treatment focusing on cognition in socially phobic children. Active comparators should be established with other evidence-based CBT programs for anxiety disorders, which differ significantly in their dosage and type of cognitive interventions from those of the manual under evaluation (e.g. Coping Cat). <EV> <t> Cognitive behavioral therapy for 4- to 7-year-old children with anxiety disorders: a randomized clinical trial. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of a developmentally appropriate parent-child cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol for anxiety disorders in children ages 4-7 years. METHOD: DESIGN: Randomized wait-list controlled trial. Conduct: Sixty-four children (53% female, mean age 5.4 years, 80% European American) with anxiety disorders were randomized to a parent-child CBT intervention (n = 34) or a 6-month wait-list condition (n = 30). Children were assessed by interviewers blind to treatment assignment, using structured diagnostic interviews with parents, laboratory assessments of behavioral inhibition, and parent questionnaires. ANALYSIS: Chi-square analyses of outcome rates and linear and ordinal regression of repeated measures, examining time by intervention interactions. RESULTS: The response rate (much or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Anxiety) among 57 completers was 69% versus 32% (CBT vs. controls), p < .01; intent-to-treat: 59% vs. 30%, p = .016. Treated children showed a significantly greater decrease in anxiety disorders (effect size [ES] = .55) and increase in parent-rated coping (ES = .69) than controls, as well as significantly better CGI improvement on social phobia/avoidant disorder (ES = .95), separation anxiety disorder (ES = .82), and specific phobia (ES = .78), but not on generalized anxiety disorder. Results on the Child Behavior Checklist Internalizing scale were not significant and were limited by low return rates. Treatment response was unrelated to age or parental anxiety but was negatively predicted by behavioral inhibition. Gains were maintained at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that developmentally modified parent-child CBT may show promise in 4- to 7-year-old children. <EV> <t> Randomized controlled trial: Multimodal Anxiety and Social Skill Intervention for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. <abs> Anxiety is common among adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and may amplify the core social disability, thus necessitating combined treatment approaches. This pilot, randomized controlled trial evaluated the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of the Multimodal Anxiety and Social Skills Intervention (MASSI) program in a sample of 30 adolescents with ASD and anxiety symptoms of moderate or greater severity. The treatment was acceptable to families, subject adherence was high, and therapist fidelity was high. A 16 % improvement in ASD social impairment (within-group effect size = 1.18) was observed on a parent-reported scale. Although anxiety symptoms declined by 26 %, the change was not statistically significant. These findings suggest MASSI is a feasible treatment program and further evaluation is warranted. <EV> <t> Effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy on anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorders: a randomized controlled trial. <abs> We compared the effects of a 16-week Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program and a Social Recreational (SR) program on anxiety in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Seventy children (9-16 years old) were randomly assigned to either of the programs (n (CBT) = 36; n (SR) = 34). Measures on child's anxiety using the Spence Child Anxiety Scale--Child (SCAS-C) and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI--S) were administered at pre-, post-treatment, and follow-ups (3- and 6-month). Children in both programs showed significantly lower levels of generalized anxiety and total anxiety symptoms at 6-month follow-up on SCAS-C. Clinician ratings on the CGI-S demonstrated an increase in the percentage of participants rated as \"Normal\" and \"Borderline\" for both programs. Findings from the present study suggest factors such as regular sessions in a structured setting, consistent therapists, social exposure and the use of autism-friendly strategies are important components of an effective framework in the management of anxiety in children and adolescents with ASD. <EV> <t> Treating adolescents with social anxiety disorder in school: an attention control trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are often undetected and untreated in adolescents. This study evaluates the relative efficacy of a school-based, cognitive-behavioral intervention compared to an educational-supportive treatment for adolescents with social anxiety disorder. METHODS: Thirty-six students (30 females), ages 14 to 16, were randomized to a 12-week specific intervention, Skills for Social and Academic Success (SASS), or a credible attention control matched for structure and contact, conducted in school. RESULTS: Independent evaluations and adolescent self-reports indicated significant reduction in social anxiety for SASS compared to the control group. Parent reports of their children's social anxiety did not discriminate between treatments. In the specific intervention, 59%, compared to 0% in the control, no longer met criteria for social anxiety disorder following treatment. Superiority of the SASS intervention was maintained 6 months after treatment cessation. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence that intervention for social anxiety disorder that emphasizes exposure and social skills is efficacious. Results indicate that clinical improvement is sustained for at least 6 months, and that, overall, adolescents with social anxiety disorder do not respond to non-specific treatment. This investigation has public health implications by demonstrating that effective interventions can be transported to nonclinical settings. <EV> <t> School-based intervention for adolescents with social anxiety disorder: results of a controlled study. <abs> Social anxiety disorder, whose onset peaks in adolescence, is associated with significant impairment. Despite the availability of effective treatments, few affected youth receive services. Transporting interventions into schools may circumvent barriers to treatment. The efficacy of a school-based intervention for social anxiety disorder was examined in a randomized wait-list control trial of 35 adolescents (26 females). Independent evaluators, blind to treatment condition, evaluated participants at preintervention, postintervention, and 9 months later. Adolescents in the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater reductions than controls in social anxiety and avoidance, as well as significantly improved overall functioning. In addition, 67% of treated subjects, compared to 6% of wait-list participants, no longer met criteria for social phobia following treatment. Findings support the possible efficacy of school-based intervention for facilitating access to treatment for socially anxious adolescents. <EV> <t> Cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorders: a randomized, controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Children with autism spectrum disorders often present with comorbid anxiety disorders that cause significant functional impairment. This study tested a modular cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program for children with this profile. A standard CBT program was augmented with multiple treatment components designed to accommodate or remediate the social and adaptive skill deficits of children with ASD that could pose barriers to anxiety reduction. METHOD: Forty children (7-11 years old) were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of CBT or a 3-month waitlist (36 completed treatment or waitlist). Therapists worked with individual families. The CBT model emphasized behavioral experimentation, parent-training, and school consultation. Independent evaluators blind to treatment condition conducted structured diagnostic interviews and parents and children completed anxiety symptom checklists at baseline and posttreatment/postwaitlist. RESULTS: In intent-to-treat analyses, 78.5% of the CBT group met Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale criteria for positive treatment response at posttreatment, as compared to only 8.7% of the waitlist group. CBT also outperformed the waitlist on diagnostic outcomes and parent reports of child anxiety, but not children's self-reports. Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The CBT manual employed in this study is one of the first adaptations of an evidence-based treatment for children with autism spectrum disorders. Remission of anxiety disorders appears to be an achievable goal among high-functioning children with autism. <EV> <t> Do anxiety-disordered children need to come into the clinic for efficacious treatment? <abs> OBJECTIVE: This study compared 3 experimental conditions: wait-list, therapist-supported bibliotherapy, and individual therapy, in the treatment of child anxiety. METHOD: Participants were 55 children (25 girls and 30 boys), aged 7 to 14 years diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and their parents. Families were assigned using a modified random assignment process to 1 of the 3 conditions. The intervention evaluated in the 2 active treatment conditions was a family-focused, cognitive-behavioral program. RESULTS: At posttreatment, participants in both treatment conditions had improved significantly on both diagnostic and questionnaire outcome measures compared with participants in the wait-list condition, with no differences demonstrated between the treatment conditions. Thus, at posttreatment, 0% of children in the wait-list condition were anxiety diagnosis free, compared with 95% in the therapist-supported bibliotherapy condition and 78.3% in the individual therapy condition. There was no significant difference between diagnostic status at posttreatment between the 2 treatment conditions. Participants assigned to a treatment condition were reassessed at 3-month and 6-month follow-up. Treatment gains were maintained in both conditions across the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: In light of the fact that more than 80% of anxiety-disordered children never receive treatment, these data suggest that therapist-supported bibliotherapy represents a cost-effective means of reaching a greater number of anxious children. <EV> <t> Cognitive-behavioural therapy for young children with anxiety disorders: Comparison of a Child + Parent condition versus a Parent Only condition. <abs> The present study compared the efficacy of a group-based cognitive-behavioural treatment (GCBT) delivered exclusively to parents of young anxious children (between 4 and 8 years of age) with the same intervention delivered to both children and parents, relative to a Wait-list Control condition. Parents of children in the Parent Only condition (N = 25) received 10 weekly sessions of GCBT whereas children and parents in the Parent + Child condition (N = 24) each received 10 weekly sessions of GCBT. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that both active treatment conditions were superior to the Wait-list condition (N = 11), with 55.3% of children in the Parent Only condition and 54.8% of children in the Parent + Child condition no longer meeting criteria for their principal diagnosis at post-treatment. These treatment gains were maintained in both treatment conditions at six-month and 12-month follow-up assessments. There were no significant differences between the two active conditions on other outcome measures including parental psychopathology and parenting style. However, an unexpected finding was that parenting satisfaction and to some extent parenting competence reduced significantly from pre- to post-treatment regardless of the active treatment condition. The present results suggest that GCBT delivered exclusively to parents of young anxious children may be a viable treatment alternative for improving accessibility to efficacious treatments for children with anxiety disorders and for reducing costs associated with mental health care delivery. <EV> <t> Cognitive behavioral therapy, sertraline, or a combination in childhood anxiety. <abs> BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are common psychiatric conditions affecting children and adolescents. Although cognitive behavioral therapy and selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors have shown efficacy in treating these disorders, little is known about their relative or combined efficacy. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled trial, we assigned 488 children between the ages of 7 and 17 years who had a primary diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or social phobia to receive 14 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, sertraline (at a dose of up to 200 mg per day), a combination of sertraline and cognitive behavioral therapy, or a placebo drug for 12 weeks in a 2:2:2:1 ratio. We administered categorical and dimensional ratings of anxiety severity and impairment at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. RESULTS: The percentages of children who were rated as very much or much improved on the Clinician Global Impression-Improvement scale were 80.7% for combination therapy (P<0.001), 59.7% for cognitive behavioral therapy (P<0.001), and 54.9% for sertraline (P<0.001); all therapies were superior to placebo (23.7%). Combination therapy was superior to both monotherapies (P<0.001). Results on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale documented a similar magnitude and pattern of response; combination therapy had a greater response than cognitive behavioral therapy, which was equivalent to sertraline, and all therapies were superior to placebo. Adverse events, including suicidal and homicidal ideation, were no more frequent in the sertraline group than in the placebo group. No child attempted suicide. There was less insomnia, fatigue, sedation, and restlessness associated with cognitive behavioral therapy than with sertraline. CONCLUSIONS: Both cognitive behavioral therapy and sertraline reduced the severity of anxiety in children with anxiety disorders; a combination of the two therapies had a superior response rate. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00052078.) <EV> <t> Disorder-specific cognitive-behavioral therapy for separation anxiety disorder in young children: a randomized waiting-list-controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Separation anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the earliest and most common mental disorders in childhood, and a strong predictor of adult psychopathology. Despite significant progress in psychotherapy research on childhood anxiety disorders, no randomized controlled trial has been conducted with a disorder-specific treatment program for young children suffering from SAD. METHODS: Forty-three children (ages 5-7) with SAD and their parents were assigned to either a 16-session disorder-specific SAD treatment program including parent training and classical cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) components, or to a 12-week waiting list group. Categorical and/or continuous data for anxiety, impairment/distress and quality of life were collected at baseline, after treatment/waiting list condition, and at a 4-week follow-up. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses indicate that 76.19% of children allocated to the treatment group definitively no longer fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for SAD at follow-up, compared to 13.64% in the waiting list group. Between 91 and 100% of children rated themselves or were rated by their father, mother or therapist as very much or much improved on the global success rating immediately after treatment. Results indicated large time by treatment condition interaction effect sizes (d = 0.98-1.41) across informants for reduction of distress/avoidance in separation situations after the test for the treatment condition. Further, parents reported significant improvements in impairment/distress in the child's major life domains and the child's quality of life. Treatment gains were maintained at the 4-week follow-up assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate the short-term efficacy of a disorder-specific treatment approach for SAD, and are among the first to indicate that CBT programs work with young children. <EV> <t> One year follow-up to modular cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders in an elementary school setting. <abs> The current study sought to evaluate the relative long-term efficacy of a modularized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program for children with anxiety disorders. Twenty four children (5-12 years old) randomly assigned to modular CBT or a 3-month waitlist participated in a 1-year follow-up assessment. Independent evaluators blind to treatment condition conducted structured diagnostic interviews, and caregivers and children completed symptom checklists at pre- and post-, and 1 year follow-up assessments. Analyses revealed that 71.4% of children who received CBT demonstrated a positive treatment response 1 year following treatment, and 83.3% were free of any anxiety diagnosis at 1 year follow-up. Analyses further revealed robust effects of intervention on diagnostic outcomes, caregiver- and child-report measures of anxiety at 1 year follow-up.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Randomized trial of nasal synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation compared with continuous positive airway pressure after extubation of very low birth weight infants. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To determine whether noninvasive, nasal synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (nSIMV) improves the likelihood that very low birth weight infants will be successfully extubated. METHODS: Infants of <1251-g birth weight who were due to be extubated before 6 weeks of age were eligible once they were receiving <35% oxygen and were on a ventilator rate of <18 breaths per minute (bpm). Extubation was performed following intravenous loading with aminophylline, after a successful trial of 12 hours of endotracheal synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation at a rate of 8. Infants were randomized to either nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) at 6 cm H(2)O or nSIMV after extubation. nSIMV was commenced at a rate of 12 bpm with pressure on the ventilator set to achieve a delivered pressure of at least 12 cm H(2)O and a peak end expiratory pressure of 6 cm H(2)O. Continuous recording for diagnosis of apnea was performed for 72 hours after extubation. Objective criteria for failure of extubation were as follows: a PaCO(2) >70; FIO(2) >0.7; or severe recurrent apnea (>2 apneas requiring intermittent positive-pressure ventilation in 24 hours or >6 apneas >20 seconds per day). The study ended after 72 hours postextubation or when infants satisfied failure criteria. A sample size of 54 was determined by power analysis. RESULTS: Mean birth weight (831 standard deviation [SD]: 193 g) and gestation (26.3 SD: 1.8 weeks) did not differ between groups. Mean age at extubation was 7.6 (SD: 9.7) days, range 1 to 40 days. The nSIMV group had a lower incidence of failed extubation 4/27 compared with the continuous positive airway pressure group, 12/27. This was attributable to both a decreased incidence of apnea and a decreased incidence of hypercarbia. There was no increase in the incidence of abdominal distension or feeding intolerance. DISCUSSION: nSIMV is effective in preventing extubation failure in very low birth weight infants in the first 72 hours after extubation. Noninvasive ventilation may have other roles in the care of the very low birth weight infant. <EV> <t> A prospective randomized, controlled trial comparing synchronized nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation versus nasal continuous positive airway pressure as modes of extubation. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To determine whether synchronized nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (SNIPPV) would decrease extubation failure compared with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) in preterm infants being ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). METHODS: Infants who were </=34 weeks' gestational age and who were ventilated for RDS were randomized to either SNIPPV or NCPAP after extubation. The criteria for extubation were peak inspiratory pressure of </=16 cm H(2)O, positive end expiratory pressure of </=5 cm H(2)O, intermittent mandatory ventilation rate of 15 to 25, and fraction of inspired oxygen </=0.35. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) were obtained before extubation. After extubation, blood gases were monitored for a minimum of 72 hours. Success was defined as remaining in the selected mode of treatment or demonstrating improvement (switching to oxyhood/nasal cannula/room air) by 72 hours. RESULTS: Thirty-two (94%) of 34 infants were extubated successfully with the use of SNIPPV versus 18 (60%) of 30 with the use of NCPAP (P <.01). There was no difference in apnea/bradycardia episodes in the 2 groups during the 72-hour study period. Among 55 infants who had PFT, 80% (8 of 10) with dynamic lung compliance of >/=0.5 mL/kg/cm H(2)O and expiratory airway resistance of </=70 cm H(2)O/L/s were extubated successfully. In infants with poor lung function (dynamic lung compliance: <0.5 mL/kg/cm H(2)O; expiratory airway resistance: >70 cm H(2)O/L/s), successful extubation was seen in 93% (27 of 29) in the SNIPPV group and 60% (15 of 25) in the NCPAP group.

METHODS: A total of 118 patients with RMS were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive oral placebo or teriflunomide, 7 or 14 mg, once daily for 24 weeks; 86 patients entered the 24-week extension. The primary objective was to evaluate safety; secondary objectives were to evaluate the effects of treatment on disease activity assessed by MRI and relapse rate. RESULTS: Teriflunomide was well tolerated with a low and similar incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) across the 3 groups; TEAEs led to treatment discontinuation of 4.9%, 8.1%, and 7.9% of patients in the placebo, 7-mg, and 14-mg groups, respectively. The number of gadolinium-enhancing T1 (T1-Gd) lesions was reduced in both teriflunomide groups, with relative risk reductions (RRRs) of 84.6% (p = 0.0005) and 82.8% (p < 0.0001) for 7 and 14 mg, respectively, compared with IFNbeta alone at 48 weeks. T1-Gd lesion volume was also reduced in the 7-mg group (RRR 72.1%, p = 0.1104) and 14-mg group (RRR 70.6%, p = 0.0154).

STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-six women with stress incontinence, low-pressure urethra, and urethral hypermobility (straining cotton swab angle >/=30 degrees ) were randomly assigned to undergo either a modified Burch procedure (n = 19) or a suburethral sling (n = 17).

Comparisons of group means were performed with the Student t test for independent groups, and proportions were compared with the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: After the operation the 2 groups had statistically similar cure rates and voiding function.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Artesunate versus quinine in the treatment of severe falciparum malaria in African children (AQUAMAT): an open-label, randomised trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Severe malaria is a major cause of childhood death and often the main reason for paediatric hospital admission in sub-Saharan Africa. Quinine is still the established treatment of choice, although evidence from Asia suggests that artesunate is associated with a lower mortality. We compared parenteral treatment with either artesunate or quinine in African children with severe malaria. METHODS: This open-label, randomised trial was undertaken in 11 centres in nine African countries. Children (<15 years) with severe falciparum malaria were randomly assigned to parenteral artesunate or parenteral quinine. Randomisation was in blocks of 20, with study numbers corresponding to treatment allocations kept inside opaque sealed paper envelopes. The trial was open label at each site, and none of the investigators or trialists, apart from for the trial statistician, had access to the summaries of treatment allocations. The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN50258054. FINDINGS: 5425 children were enrolled; 2712 were assigned to artesunate and 2713 to quinine. All patients were analysed for the primary outcome. 230 (8.5%) patients assigned to artesunate treatment died compared with 297 (10.9%) assigned to quinine treatment (odds ratio [OR] stratified for study site 0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.90; relative reduction 22.5%, 95% CI 8.1-36.9; p=0.0022). Incidence of neurological sequelae did not differ significantly between groups, but the development of coma (65/1832 [3.5%] with artesunate vs 91/1768 [5.1%] with quinine; OR 0.69 95% CI 0.49-0.95; p=0.0231), convulsions (224/2712 [8.3%] vs 273/2713 [10.1%]; OR 0.80, 0.66-0.97; p=0.0199), and deterioration of the coma score (166/2712 [6.1%] vs 208/2713 [7.7%]; OR 0.78, 0.64-0.97; p=0.0245) were all significantly less frequent in artesunate recipients than in quinine recipients. Post-treatment hypoglycaemia was also less frequent in patients assigned to artesunate than in those assigned to quinine (48/2712 [1.8%] vs 75/2713 [2.8%]; OR 0.63, 0.43-0.91; p=0.0134). Artesunate was well tolerated, with no serious drug-related adverse effects. INTERPRETATION: Artesunate substantially reduces mortality in African children with severe malaria. These data, together with a meta-analysis of all trials comparing artesunate and quinine, strongly suggest that parenteral artesunate should replace quinine as the treatment of choice for severe falciparum malaria worldwide.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Barthel Index (0-100) served as the primary outcome measure and the Rivermead Motor Assessment Score with its three sections (gross function, leg and trunk, and arm) as the secondary outcome measure, assessed at days 0, 20, 36, 90, 180 and 360. RESULTS: The two groups did not differ with respect to clinical data and outcome measures at study onset. All patients improved significantly except for arm function over the intervention period and up to day 90 after study onset. The comparison between groups did not reveal any difference at any time; amphetamine-treated patients did not show any increase in motor function or ADL compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The placebo-controlled study failed to show any effect of D-amphetamine on stroke recovery compared with control.

Limited information is available on treatment safety. This study intended to investigate the safety and tolerability of dexamphetamine in patients with acute cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Forty-five patients with cerebral ischemia were enrolled within 72 hours after onset of symptoms. Patients were randomized to 1 of 3 dose levels (2.5, 5, or 10 mg orally twice daily) or placebo for 5 consecutive days. Adverse events, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, consciousness level, and functional outcome measures were followed up daily during treatment. Follow-ups were made at day 7 and 1 and 3 months after stroke. RESULTS: Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate increased 14 mm Hg, 8 mm Hg, and 9 bpm, respectively, with dexamphetamine treatment compared with placebo (P< or =0.01). There was no difference between dexamphetamine and placebo regarding adverse events, body temperature, or consciousness level. During treatment, there was a benefit of dexamphetamine in neurological and functional outcome (P<0.05), but differences were not maintained at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, dexamphetamine was safe and well tolerated by patients with acute cerebral ischemia, but blood pressure and heart rate increased during treatment in comparison to placebo. These observations may be important in the future planning of amphetamine trials because changes in these variables have been observed to interfere with clinical outcome. The suggestions of improvement in outcome must be confirmed in further studies. <EV> <t> Amphetamine fails to facilitate motor performance and to enhance motor recovery among stroke patients with mild arm paresis: interim analysis and termination of a double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. <abs> PURPOSE: To assess the effects of d-amphetamine on motor facilitation and recovery in stroke patients with mild arm paresis receiving the Arm Ability training. METHODS: Thirty-one stroke patients with mild arm paresis were randomly assigned to either (a.) receiving placebo or (b.) d-amphetamine twice a week 2 hours before Arm Ability training sessions for three weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: time needed to perform TEMPA tasks, a measure of upper extremity performance reflecting everyday life tasks. Secondary measures: aimed movements, tapping, and a 10 m walkway as well as motor performance during training sessions. RESULTS: The interim efficacy analysis of 26 stroke patients who completed the study intervention showed overall arm motor recovery both from pre to post test after 3 weeks of training and from pre test to follow-up 1 year later. No superior effect of d-amphetamine over placebo could be substantiated for either motor facilitation during training or motor recovery (post training or long-term). D-amphetamine exerted mild effects on blood pressure. Serious adverse events were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: d-Amphetamine failed to facilitate motor performance during training sessions, to promote skill acquisition with training tasks, and most importantly to enhance motor recovery among patients with mild arm paresis after stroke. <EV> <t> Physiotherapy coupled with dextroamphetamine for rehabilitation after hemiparetic stroke: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hemiparesis is the commonest disabling deficit caused by stroke. In animals, dextroamphetamine (AMPH) paired with training enhances motor recovery, but its clinical efficacy is uncertain. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 71 stroke patients were stratified by hemiparesis severity and randomly assigned to 10 sessions of physiotherapy coupled with either 10 mg AMPH or placebo. Study treatments were administered by 1 physiotherapist, beginning 5 to 10 days after stroke and continuing twice per week for 5 weeks. Outcomes were assessed by 1 physiotherapist at baseline, after each treatment session, at 6 weeks, and at 3 months. The primary outcome was motor recovery (impairment level) on the Fugl-Meyer (FM) scale. Secondary outcomes assessed mobility, ambulation, arm/hand function, and independence in activities of daily living. RESULTS: Baseline hemiparesis was severe overall (mean FM score 27.7+/-20.0). Motor scores improved during treatment in both groups (mean change, baseline to 3 months 29.5+/-16.6). Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed no significant differences in recovery between the treatment groups for the entire cohort (n=67) or for subgroups with a severe hemiparesis (n=43), moderate hemiparesis (n=24), or cortically based stroke (n=26). In the moderate subgroup, there was a significant drug x time interaction for upper extremity motor recovery (F=5.14; P<0.001), although there was a significant baseline imbalance in motor scores in this subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: In stroke patients with a severe motor deficit, 10 mg AMPH coupled with physiotherapy twice per week for 5 weeks in the early poststroke period provided no additional benefit in motor or functional recovery compared with physiotherapy alone.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Low-dose dexamethasone facilitates extubation among chronically ventilator-dependent infants: a multicenter, international, randomized, controlled trial. <abs> OBJECTIVE: Postnatal corticosteroid therapy is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the short-term effects of low-dose dexamethasone treatment among chronically ventilator-dependent neonates. METHODS: Very preterm (gestational age: <28 weeks) or extremely low birth weight (birth weight: <1000 g) infants who were ventilator dependent after the first 1 week of life were eligible and were assigned randomly to receive masked dexamethasone (0.89 mg/kg over 10 days) or saline placebo. Data on ventilator and oxygen requirements and deaths were recorded. RESULTS: Seventy infants were recruited from 11 centers, at a median age of 23 days. More infants were extubated successfully by 10 days of treatment in the dexamethasone group (60%, 21 of 35 patients) than in the control group (12%, 4 of 34 patients) (odds ratio [OR]: 11.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.2-39.0). Ventilator and oxygen requirements improved substantially, and the duration of intubation was shorter. There was little evidence for a reduction in either the mortality rate (dexamethasone group: 11%; control group: 20%; OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.14-1.95) or the rate of oxygen dependence at 36 weeks (dexamethasone group: 85%; control group: 91%; OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.13-2.66). There were no obvious effects of low-dose dexamethasone on blood glucose concentrations, blood pressure, or other complications. No infant experienced intestinal perforation. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose dexamethasone treatment after the first 1 week of life clearly facilitates extubation and shortens the duration of intubation among ventilator-dependent, very preterm/extremely low birth weight infants, without any obvious short-term complications. Combined with recent evidence that infants at very high risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia may benefit in the long term, our study reopens debate regarding the role of low-dose, late postnatal, corticosteroid therapy. <EV> <t> Effect of dexamethasone on tracheobronchial aspirate fluid cytology and pulmonary mechanics in preterm infants. <abs> The changes induced on respiratory mechanics and on tracheobronchial aspirate fluid (TAF) cytology by dexamethasone courses started at two different postnatal ages in preterm infants at risk of chronic lung disease (CLD) were reported in this clinical trial designed in two phases. The first phase of the study included 20 neonates with birth weight < or = 1,250 g and gestational age < or = 32 weeks, who were oxygen and ventilator dependent on the 10th day of life. They were randomly assigned to the moderately early dexamethasone (MED) group or to the control group. The second phase of the study included 20 neonates with the same characteristics, oxygen and ventilator dependent on the 4th day of life, randomly assigned to the early dexamethasone (ED) group or to the control group. Both treated groups received dexamethasone intravenously for 7 days (0.5 mg/kg/day for the first 3 days, 0.25 mg/kg/day for the next 3 days, and 0.125 mg/kg/day for the last day of treatment). The control groups received no steroid treatment. A significantly lower absolute cell count and percentage of neutrophils (PMN) in the TAF and significantly higher dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn) values were observed in both the MED treated compared to the untreated infants and the ED treated infants compared to the control group. Moreover these changes were more precocious in the ED Group compared to the MED Group. Our study suggests that dexamethasone could be more efficacious in reducing effects of ventilator-induced lung injury in preterm infants at high risk of CLD when started earlier. <EV> <t> Adrenal suppression and extubation rate after moderately early low-dose dexamethasone therapy in very preterm infants. <abs> OBJECTIVE: A short course of moderately early dexamethasone therapy with a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day improves lung compliance and shortens the duration of ventilatory support in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). We conducted a double-blind, randomized study to evaluate whether a moderately early 14-day weaning course of low-dose dexamethasone affects adrenal function and facilitates weaning from the ventilator. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-six preterm infants with a gestational age < or =32 weeks who required ventilatory support for RDS on days 7-14 were randomized to a 14-day treatment course with dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg/day start, tapering doses) or placebo (equivalent amounts of normal saline). Prior to the first study treatment and the day after completion of the treatment course, adrenal function was assessed from serum cortisol levels drawn before and 30 min after intravenous administration of 0.1 mg Cortrosyn. Extubation rate during treatment in both groups was compared. RESULTS: In both groups baseline serum cortisol levels decreased significantly during treatment, but stimulated cortisol levels did not change. After the 14-day treatment course, stimulated cortisol levels increased significantly from baseline levels in both groups (p<0.001), following Cortrosyn administration. More infants in the dexamethasone group were extubated within 7-14 days of study entry than in the placebo group (p<0.05). Hyperglycemia was more frequently diagnosed in the dexamethasone group and open-label dexamethasone treatment was given more frequently in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A moderately early 14-day weaning course of low-dose dexamethasone does not significantly suppress the adrenal function of very preterm infants with RDS, but accelerates weaning from the ventilator.", "summary:reference": "The benefits of late corticosteroid therapy may not outweigh actual or potential adverse effects.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Single versus weekly courses of antenatal corticosteroids: evaluation of safety and efficacy. <abs> OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if weekly corticosteroids improve neonatal outcome without undue harm. STUDY DESIGN: Women 23 to 32 weeks receiving 1 course of corticosteroids 7 to 10 days prior were randomized to weekly betamethasone or placebo. RESULTS: The study was terminated by the independent data and safety monitoring committee with 495 of the anticipated 2400 patients enrolled. There was no significant reduction in the composite primary morbidity outcome (8.0% vs 9.1%, P = .67). Repeated courses significantly reduced neonatal surfactant administration (P = .02), mechanical ventilation (P = .004), CPAP (P = .05), pneumothoraces (P = .03). There was no significant difference in mean birth weight or head circumference. The repeat group had a reduction in multiples of the birth weight median by gestational age (0.88 vs 0.91) (P = .01) and more neonates weighing less than the 10th percentile (23.7 vs 15.3%, P = .02). Significant weight reductions occurred for the group receiving > or = 4 courses. CONCLUSION: Repeat antenatal corticosteroids significantly reduce specific neonatal morbidities but do not improve composite neonatal outcome. This is accompanied by reduction in birth weight and increase in small for gestational age infants. <EV> <t> Randomized trial of a single repeat dose of prenatal betamethasone treatment in imminent preterm birth. <abs> BACKGROUND: A single dose of prenatal betamethasone treatment decreases neonatal morbidity rates when administered within 7 days before preterm delivery. A single repeat dose or booster dose of betamethasone before delivery has been proposed to be effective, but its efficacy has not been subjected to a randomized, blinded trial. METHODS: Women with imminent delivery before 34.0 gestational weeks were eligible if they remained without delivery for >7 days after a single course of betamethasone. After stratification, a single repeat dose of betamethasone (12 mg) or placebo was administered. The primary outcome was survival without respiratory distress syndrome or severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grade 3 or 4). RESULTS: A total of 249 mothers had been enrolled by the time the study was discontinued. All of the 159 infants in the betamethasone group and 167 in the placebo group were born before 36 weeks of gestation. The intact survival rate was unaffected and was lower than anticipated, because the gestational age-adjusted incidence of respiratory distress syndrome was higher than the population incidence. The requirement for surfactant therapy in respiratory distress syndrome was increased in the betamethasone group. According to posthoc analysis of the data for 206 infants who were delivered within 1 to 24 hours, the betamethasone booster tended to increase the risk of respiratory distress syndrome and to decrease intact survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: According to this study, a single booster dose of betamethasone just before preterm birth may perturb respiratory adaptation. These results caution against uncontrolled use of a repeat dose of glucocorticoid in high-risk pregnancies. <EV> <t> Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome after repeat exposure to antenatal corticosteroids: a randomised controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids remains uncertain. Our aim was to establish whether repeat prenatal corticosteroids given to women at risk of preterm birth can reduce neonatal morbidity without harm. METHODS: In this hospital-based study, 982 women who remained at risk of preterm birth at less than 32 weeks' gestation, 7 or more days after receiving a first course of prenatal corticosteroids, were randomly assigned to receive a repeat intramuscular dose of either 11.4 mg betamethasone (as Celestone Chronodose), or saline placebo. This was repeated every week the woman remained undelivered, at less than 32 weeks' gestation, and at risk of preterm birth. Primary outcomes were occurrence and severity of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, use and duration of oxygen and mechanical ventilation, and weight, length, and head circumference at birth and hospital discharge. Statistical analyses were on an intention to treat basis. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN48656428. FINDINGS: Fewer babies exposed to repeat corticosteroids had respiratory distress syndrome (33%vs 41%; relative risk 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.95, p=0.01) and fewer had severe lung disease (12%vs 20%; relative risk 0.60, 95% CI 0.46-0.79, p=0.0003) than those in the placebo group. In keeping with these benefits, babies exposed to repeat corticosteroids needed less oxygen therapy (p=0.03), and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (p=0.01). Mean weight, length, and head circumference at birth and hospital discharge did not differ between treatment groups. Z-scores for weight (p=0.04) and head circumference (p=0.03) at birth were lower in the babies who received repeat corticosteroids although at the time of hospital discharge Z-scores did not differ between treatment groups (p=0.29 for weight, p=0.48 for head circumference).

Although several randomized-controlled trials have assessed the therapeutic role of antidepressant drugs, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. AIM: To compare the effects of low-dose amitriptyline in the treatment of diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in a double-blind randomized-controlled trial. METHODS: Fifty-four patients who fulfilled Rome II criteria for diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome were included in this study. Organic causes were ruled out by standard laboratory and radiological tests, and rectosigmoidoscopy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg amitriptyline daily or placebo. Subjects were followed up for 2 months and symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis was performed. RESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study. At 2 months, the amitriptyline group showed greater (P < 0.05) reduction in the incidence of loose stool and feeling of incomplete defecation. Patients receiving amitriptyline showed greater complete response, defined as loss of all symptoms, compared with those receiving placebo (68% vs. 28%, P = 0.01).

AIM: To compare the effects of fluoxetine and placebo in the treatment of pain and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in a double-blind randomized-controlled trial. METHODS: Forty-four cases meeting Rome II criteria for irritable bowel syndrome with predominance of pain and constipation were included in this study. Organic causes were ruled out by detailed history, physical examination, laboratory tests and colonoscopy. Participants were then randomly assigned to receive either fluoxetine or placebo for 12 weeks. Symptoms addressed by the Rome II criteria were recorded during treatment and 4 weeks after termination of treatment. RESULTS: Fluoxetine was significantly more effective than placebo in decreasing abdominal discomfort, relieving feeling and sense of bloating, increasing frequency of bowel movements and decreasing consistency of stool. Mean number of symptoms per patient decreased from 4.6 to 0.7 in the fluoxetine group vs. 4.5 to 2.9 in controls (P < 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: The authors examined the efficacy and safety of paroxetine controlled-release (paroxetine-CR) in patients with IBS. METHOD: Seventy-two patients with IBS participated in a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of paroxetine-CR (12.5 mg-50 mg/day). Efficacy was measured by Composite Pain Scores (primary outcome) and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) and Severity (CGI-S) ratings. RESULTS: In intent-to-treat analyses, there were no significant differences between paroxetine-CR (N=36) and placebo (N=36) on reduction in Composite Pain Scores, although the proportion of responders on CGI-I was significantly higher in the paroxetine-CR group. The treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The study did not demonstrate a statistically significant benefit for paroxetine-CR over placebo on the primary outcome measure, although there was improvement in secondary outcome measures. Overall, paroxetine-CR seems to have potential benefit in IBS. Studies with adequate samples may clarify the role of paroxetine-CR in IBS. <EV> <t> A controlled crossover study of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram in irritable bowel syndrome. <abs> INTRODUCTION: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are frequently used in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) although evidence of their efficacy is scarce. AIM: Twenty three non-depressed IBS patients were recruited from a tertiary care centre and included in a crossover trial comparing six weeks of treatment with the SSRI citalopram (20 mg for three weeks, 40 mg for three weeks) with placebo. IBS symptom severity was the primary outcome measure, and depression and anxiety scores were also measured. The effect of acute administration of citalopram on colonic sensitivity and on colonic response to feeding was investigated as a putative predictor of symptomatic response to the drug. RESULTS: After three and six weeks of treatment, citalopram significantly improved abdominal pain, bloating, impact of symptoms on daily life, and overall well being compared with placebo. There was only a modest effect on stool pattern. Changes in depression or anxiety scores were not related to symptom improvement. The effect of acute administration of citalopram during a colonic barostat study did not predict clinical outcome. Analysis of the first treatment period as a double blind parallel arm study confirmed the benefit of citalopram over placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The SSRI citalopram significantly improves IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain, compared with placebo. The therapeutic effect is independent of effects on anxiety, depression, and colonic sensorimotor function. <EV> <t> Antidepressant therapy (imipramine and citalopram) for irritable bowel syndrome: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: The efficacy of antidepressants in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is controversial. No trials have directly compared a tricyclic with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Our aim was to determine whether imipramine and citalopram are efficacious in IBS. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group pilot trial with imipramine (50 mg) and citalopram (40 mg). RESULTS: Of 51 IBS patients randomized, baseline characteristics were comparable among the treatment arms; the majority was diarrhea-predominant. Adequate relief of IBS symptoms (primary endpoint) was similar for each treatment arm. Improvements in bowel symptom severity rating for interference (P = 0.05) and distress (P = 0.02) were greater with imipramine versus placebo, but improvements in abdominal pain were not. There was a greater improvement in depression score (P = 0.08) and in the SF-36 Mental Component Score (P = 0.07), with imipramine. Citalopram was not superior to placebo. Approximately 20% of the variance in scores was explained by treatment differences for abdominal pain, bowel symptom severity disability, depression and the mental component of the SF-36. CONCLUSION: Neither imipramine nor citalopram significantly improved global IBS endpoints over placebo. <EV> <t> Peppermint oil (Mintoil) in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: a prospective double blind placebo-controlled randomized trial. <abs> INTRODUCTION: The use of peppermint oil in treating the irritable bowel syndrome has been studied with variable results probably due to the presence of patients affected by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance or celiac disease that may have symptoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome. AIM: The aim of the study was to test the effectiveness of enteric-coated peppermint oil in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in whom small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance and celiac disease were excluded. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with irritable bowel syndrome according to the Rome II criteria, with normal lactose and lactulose breath tests and negative antibody screening for celiac disease, were treated with peppermint oil (two enteric-coated capsules twice per day or placebo) for 4 weeks in a double blind study. The symptoms were assessed before therapy (T(0)), after the first 4 weeks of therapy (T(4)) and 4 weeks after the end of therapy (T(8)). The symptoms evaluated were: abdominal bloating, abdominal pain or discomfort, diarrhoea, constipation, feeling of incomplete evacuation, pain at defecation, passage of gas or mucus and urgency at defecation. For each symptom intensity and frequency from 0 to 4 were scored. The total irritable bowel syndrome symptoms score was also calculated as the mean value of the sum of the average of the intensity and frequency scores of each symptom. RESULTS: At T(4), 75% of the patients in the peppermint oil group showed a >50% reduction of basal (T(0)) total irritable bowel syndrome symptoms score compared with 38% in the placebo group (P<0.009). With peppermint oil at T(4) and at T(8) compared with T(0) a statistically significant reduction of the total irritable bowel syndrome symptoms score was found (T(0): 2.19+/-0.13, T(4): 1.07+/-0.10*, T(8): 1.60+/-0.10*, *P<0.01 compared with T(0), mean+/-S.E.M.), while no change was found with the placebo.

The duration of treatment was eight to 12 weeks and this consisted of 10-20 g/day of coarse wheat bran or a low fibre placebo taken in addition to the normal diet. Twenty-eight outpatients fulfilling the Rome criteria for constipation-predominant IBS were recruited to the trial (14 in the treatment group; 14 in the placebo group). Twelve people completed the trial in the treatment group and ten in the placebo group. The main outcome measures included changes in symptoms recorded in a diary, changes in objective measurements of bowel function and subjective overall feelings of improvement. The bran group significantly increased their non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) intake over that of the placebo group (p < 0.05). Mean stool wet weight increased significantly more in the bran group than in the placebo group (p < 0.05), but other bowel function measurements and all recorded symptoms were not different. Many patients reported changes in bowel habit that were not reflected in the objective measurements. The addition of coarse wheat bran to the diet increased NSP ingestion and stool wet weight in this group of IBS patients, but no evidence was obtained that such treatment was of benefit to these patients, other than a placebo effect on symptoms. <EV> <t> Double-blind placebo-controlled trial of amitriptyline for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in adolescents. <abs> OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of amitriptyline (AMI) in treating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adolescents. STUDY DESIGN: Adolescents 12 to 18 years with newly diagnosed IBS were surveyed with a symptom checklist, pain rating scale, visual analog scale, and IBS quality of life (QOL) questionnaire. Subjects were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to receive AMI or placebo, and again completed surveys at 2, 6, 10, and 13 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (24 female) were enrolled. Patients receiving AMI were more likely to experience improvement from baseline in overall QOL at 6, 10, and 13 weeks (P = .019, .004, and .013). Patients receiving AMI were also more likely to experience a reduction in IBS-associated diarrhea at 6 and 10 weeks (P = .029 for both), a reduction in periumbilical pain at 10 weeks (P = .018), and a reduction in right lower quadrant pain at 6, 10, and 13 weeks (P = .014, .039, and .004).

{"document": "<EV> <t> Evaluation of home lead remediation in an Australian mining community. <abs> In 1994 a comprehensive program was established to reduce children's blood lead levels in Broken Hill, NSW, Australia. Home remediation (abatement of lead hazards in a child's home) was included as part of a case management strategy for children with blood lead levels >or=15 microg/dL. Children with blood lead levels >or=30 microg/dL were offered immediate home remediation. Children with blood lead levels of 15-29 microg/dL were allocated to 'immediate' or 'delayed' home remediation; a subset of these participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of home remediation for reducing blood lead levels. One hundred and seventeen children received home remediation. One hundred and thirteen returned for follow-up blood tests, 88 of whom participated in the RCT. On average children's blood lead levels decreased by 1.7 microg/dL (10%) in the 6 months after remediation and by 2.2 microg/dL (13%) in the 6-12 months after remediation. However, remediation did not significantly change the rate of decline in blood lead levels (P=0.609). There was no evidence of association between change in children's blood lead levels and changes in lead loading in their homes. The results are consistent with the published literature, which suggests that home remediation does not reduce children's exposure to lead sufficiently to cause a moderate or greater decrease in their blood lead level. In communities where lead is widely dispersed, the study suggests that it is important to assess potential sources and pathways by which children are exposed to lead when developing an intervention plan, and the need for multiple interventions to effectively reduce blood lead levels. The findings reinforce the ongoing need for rigorous epidemiological evaluation of lead management programs to improve the evidence base, and for effective primary prevention to avoid children being exposed to lead in the first place. <EV> <t> Primary prevention of lead exposure: the Philadelphia lead safe homes study. <abs> OBJECTIVE: Lead exposure in children can lead to neuropsychological impairment. This study tested whether primary prevention interventions in the newborn period prevent elevated blood lead levels (BLLs). METHODS: The Philadelphia Lead Safe Homes (LSH) Study offered parental education, home evaluation, and lead remediation to the families of urban newborns. Households were randomized to a standard lead education group or maintenance education group. We conducted home visits at baseline, six months, and 12 months. To compare BLLs, we identified a matched comparison group. RESULTS: We enrolled and randomized 314 newborns in the intervention component; 110 completed the study. There were few significant differences between the randomized groups. In the combined intervention groups, positive results on visual inspection declined from baseline to 12 months (97.0% to 90.6%, p = 0.007). At baseline, 36.9% of homes were above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's lead dust standard, compared with 26.9% at 12 months (p = 0.032), mainly due to a drop in windowsill dust levels. Both groups showed a significant increase in parental scores on a lead education test. Children in the intervention and matched control groups had similar geometric mean initial BLLs (2.6 vs. 2.7, p = 0.477), but a significantly higher percentage of children in the intervention group had an initial blood lead screening compared with those in the matched group (88.9% vs. 84.4%, p = 0.032).

{"document": "<EV> <t> A comparative trial of a single dose of azithromycin versus doxycycline for the treatment of mild scrub typhus. <abs> BACKGROUND: Scrub typhus is one of the most important endemic infections in the Asia-Pacific region. Although tetracyclines or chloramphenicol are the recommended drugs of choice for the treatment of scrub typhus, reports of doxycycline-resistant strains have prompted a search for alternative treatments. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, open-label, randomized trial from September 2002 through November 2003 to compare azithromycin with doxycycline for the treatment of mild scrub typhus. The time to defervescence was assessed to compare the efficacy of the 2 treatment regimens. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients were randomly assigned to receive either a single 500-mg dose of azithromycin or a 1-week course of daily oral 200-mg dose of doxycycline. Cure was achieved in 47 (100%) of 47 patients in the azithromycin-treated group and in 43 (93.5%) of 46 patients in the doxycycline-treated group (P=.117). The median time to defervescence was 21 h for the azithromycin-treated group and 29 h for the doxycycline-treated group (P=.097). There were no serious adverse events during the study. No relapses occurred in either group during a 1-month follow-up period. CONCLUSION: The single 500-mg dose of azithromycin was as effective as the 1-week course of daily 200-mg doses of doxycycline for the treatment of mild scrub typhus acquired in South Korea. <EV> <t> Controlled trial of a 5-day course of telithromycin versus doxycycline for treatment of mild to moderate scrub typhus. <abs> New antibiotics are required to have the antibacterial activity against doxycycline-resistant Orientia tsutsugamushi. An in vitro sensitivity study showed that telithromycin was more effective than erythromycin for Rickettsia, Bartonella, and Coxiella burnetii. In this prospective, open-label, randomized trial, we enrolled patients with mild-to-moderate scrub typhus. We compared the efficacy and safety of a 5-day telithromycin therapy with those of a 5-day doxycycline therapy at Chosun University Hospital or one of its two community-based affiliated hospitals (Jangheung Hospital and Cheomdan Hospital), which are all located in southwestern Korea, between September and December 2005. A total of 92 patients were randomly assigned to either the telithromycin group (n = 47) or the doxycycline group (n = 45). After the treatment, fever control time was 20.45 +/- 12.9 h in the telithromycin group and 22.60 +/- 21.44 h in the doxycycline group (P > 0.05). After the treatment, the cure rate was 100% in the telithromycin group and 97.8% in the doxycycline group (P > 0.05). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in time elapsed until such symptoms as headache, myalgia, and rash disappeared. No serious adverse events or death were noted following the treatment in both groups. There were no significant differences in adverse events. In conclusion, the efficacy and safety of a 5-day once-a-day regimen of 800 mg telithromycin were equivalent to those of a 5-day twice-a-day regimen of 100 mg doxycycline in patients with mild-to-moderate scrub typhus.

DESIGN: Prospective randomized study. SETTING: Assisted reproduction unit in an obstetrics and gynecology department in a university hospital in Greece as well as assisted reproduction unit in an urban clinic in a major city in Greece. PATIENT(S): One hundred fifteen patients with unilateral or bilateral hydrosalpinges who were candidates for IVF treatment. INTERVENTION(S): Laparoscopic proximal tubal occlusion, laparoscopic salpingectomy, controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, IVF, and embryo transfer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Implantation rate, clinical-pregnancy rate, ongoing-pregnancy rate, abortion rate, and ectopic-pregnancy rate. RESULT(S): Patients who underwent proximal tubal occlusion before IVF demonstrated significantly increased implantation, clinical-pregnancy, and ongoing-pregnancy rates compared with those with no surgical intervention and demonstrated implantation, clinical-pregnancy, and ongoing-pregnancy rates comparable to those who underwent salpingectomy. CONCLUSION(S): Proximal tubal occlusion, when performed in women with unilateral or bilateral hydrosalpinges before their IVF treatment, represents a potentially beneficial surgical procedure, increasing significantly the chances for successful implantation and for clinical and ongoing pregnancy. Proximal tubal occlusion may be viewed as a valid alternative when salpingectomy is technically difficult or not feasible. <EV> <t> Ultrasound-guided hydrosalpinx aspiration during oocyte collection improves pregnancy outcome in IVF: a randomized controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Hydrosalpinges have adverse effects on IVF outcomes. Salpingectomy is effective in improving outcomes, but it is not always practical or safe. Ultrasound-guided aspiration of hydrosalpinges at oocyte collection is an option for those who develop hydrosalpinges during controlled ovarian stimulation; however, there is no randomized evidence to show whether this practice is effective. METHODS: Between October 1999 and June 2003, consenting women of age <or=39 years with an ultrasound diagnosis of hydrosalpinx were randomized before oocyte collection to transvaginal aspiration of hydrosalpinx under antibiotics cover or no aspiration. Third-party randomization was performed using a computer algorithm, and allocation concealment was achieved with opaque sealed envelopes. Outcomes were biochemical and clinical pregnancies, implantation, spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy and pelvic infection rates. Analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: Sixty-six women were recruited to the trial, 32 to the aspiration group and 34 to the no-aspiration group. Aspiration resulted in a greater biochemical pregnancy rate [14/32 (43.8%) versus 7/34 (20.6%), relative risk (RR) = 2.1 (1.02, 4.6), P = 0.04]. Clinical pregnancy rates for aspiration versus control groups were 31.3% (10/32) and 17.6% (6/34), respectively [RR = 1.8 (0.8, 4.3), P = 0.20]. There were no changes in implantation rate or spontaneous abortion risk with aspiration and no differences between the groups in infection or ectopic pregnancy rates.

{"document": "<EV> <t> A prospective trial comparing the Holland nail with the dynamic hip screw in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures of the hip. <abs> We compared the outcome of patients treated for an intertrochanteric fracture of the femoral neck with a locked, long intramedullary nail with those treated with a dynamic hip screw (DHS) in a prospective randomised study. Each patient who presented with an extra-capsular hip fracture was randomised to operative stabilisation with either a long intramedullary Holland nail or a DHS. We treated 92 patients with a Holland nail and 98 with a DHS. Pre-operative variables included the Mini Mental test score, patient mobility, fracture pattern and American Society of Anesthesiologists grading. Peri-operative variables were anaesthetic time, operating time, radiation time and blood loss. Post-operative variables were time to mobilising with a frame, wound infection, time to discharge, time to fracture union, and mortality. We found no significant difference in the pre-operative variables. The mean anaesthetic and operation times were shorter in the DHS group than in the Holland nail group (29.7 vs 40.4 minutes, p < 0.001; and 40.3 vs 54 minutes, p < 0.001, respectively). There was an increased mean blood loss within the DHS group versus the Holland nail group (160 ml vs 78 ml, respectively, p < 0.001). The mean time to mobilisation with a frame was shorter in the Holland nail group (DHS 4.3 days, Holland nail 3.6 days, p = 0.012). More patients needed a post-operative blood transfusion in the DHS group (23 vs seven, p = 0.003) and the mean radiation time was shorter in this group (DHS 0.9 minutes vs Holland nail 1.56 minutes, p < 0.001). The screw of the DHS cut out in two patients, one of whom underwent revision to a Holland nail. There were no revisions in the Holland nail group. All fractures in both groups were united when followed up after one year. We conclude that the DHS can be implanted more quickly and with less exposure to radiation than the Holland nail. However, the resultant blood loss and need for transfusion is greater. The Holland nail allows patients to mobilise faster and to a greater extent. We have therefore adopted the Holland nail as our preferred method of treating intertrochanteric fractures of the hip. <EV> <t> The trochanteric gamma nail versus the dynamic hip screw: a prospective randomised study. One-year follow-up of 146 intertrochanteric fractures. <abs> In a prospective, randomized trial we compared the trochanteric gamma nail (TGN) and the dynamic hip screw (DHS) in the treatment of 146 intertrochanteric fractures. Follow-up was after four and 12 months. The operation time was significantly shorter in the DHS group. At discharge the need for walking aids was less in the DHS group. There were no differences in intraoperative blood loss, medical complications, mortality or length of hospital stay. Major fracture complications occurred twiceas often in the TGN group compared with the DHS group, however they were not statistically significant. Any potential for the TGN leading to a less invasive procedure and a more rapid postoperative mobilisation could not be demonstrated. Compared with the TGN we prefer the DHS for most intertrochanteric fractures in a setting where the majority of these fractures are treated by younger doctors and not by highly specialized hip/trauma surgeons. The TGN may have advantages in selected intertrochanteric fractures.; <EV> <t> Intramedullary nailing versus fixed angle blade plating for subtrochanteric femoral fractures: a prospective randomised controlled trial. <abs> PURPOSE: To compare closed intramedullary nailing to open reduction and internal fixation using a fixed angle blade plate for the management of subtrochanteric femoral fractures. METHODS: 58 patients were equally randomised to undergo either an intramedullary nailing (IN) or fixed angle blade plating (BP). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to age, time to surgery, operating time, receipt of blood transfusions, duration of hospital stay, or fracture classification. The revision rate was 28% (8/29) in the BP group and none in the IN group; the difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Internal fixation using a fixed angle blade plate for subtrochanteric femoral fractures has higher implant failure and revision rates, compared to closed intramedullary nailing. <EV> <t> A randomised comparison of AMBI, TGN and PFN for treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures. <abs> INTRODUCTION: In this study, we initiated a prospective, randomised, clinical trial comparing the AMBI, TGN and PFN operations used for treatment of unstable fractures, for differences in intra-operative use, consolidation, complications and functional outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have compared the pre-, intra- and post-operating variables of AMBI, TGN and PFN operations that were used for treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures, of 120 patients all above 60 years old diagnosed with extracapsular hip fractures classified as AO Type 31-A2 or Type 31-A3. RESULTS: According to our results the three methods are comparable in the treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures of patients above 60 years old. CONCLUSION: The AMBI remains the gold standard for the fractures of trochanteric region. TGN has an easier and faster procedure, facilitates early weight bearing and had minor late complications. An improper use of the PFN system was the reason for the most complications and the longer operation time of the device. PFN is also an accepted minimally invasive implant for unstable proximal femoral fractures but future modification of the implant to avoid Z-effect phenomenon, careful surgical technique and selection of the patients should reduce its high complication rate. <EV> <t> [Pertrochanteric fractures: a randomized prospective study comparing dynamic screw plate and intramedullary fixation]. <abs> PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The objective of this study was to compare the dynamic hip screw (Synthes) and intramedullary fixation (Targon PF, Aesculap) for the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures in terms of stability, complications and cost effectiveness. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective randomized study included 60 patients hospitalized in an emergency setting for pertrochanteric fractures between December 2003 and June 2004. All surgeons in our unit participated in the study. Two fixation systems were used: the Targon proximal femoral nail (Aesculap) and the screw-plate dynamic hip screw (Synthes). We noted: patient status (ASA classification), operative data (type of implant, duration), postoperative data (blood loss, radiographic findings, early complications), and outcome (Harris score, time to walking, mortality). All patients were assessed three months after surgery. The series included 60 patients, 14 men (23%) and 46 women (77%). The Targon PF nail was used for 34 patients and the DHS for 26. In the intramedullary fixation group mean age was 81 years (SD = 12.8, range 23-96); it was 82 years (SD 9.8, range 47-97) in the screw-plate group. The AO classification was: intramedullary fixation 31A1 (n = 11), 31A2 (n = 20), 31A3 (n = 3); screw-plate 31A1 (n = 14), 31A2 (n = 11), 31A3 (n = 1). Thirty-one fractures were stable, 29 unstable. Unstable fractures were treated with the Targon PF nail (n = 18) and the DHS screw-plate (n = 11). Stable fractures were treated with the Targon PF nail (n = 15) and the DHS screw-plate (n = 15). RESULTS: Mean operative time was 35 minutes for intramedullary nailing and 42 mintues for screw-plate fixation. Mean blood loss was 410 ml for intramedullary nailing and 325 ml for screw-plate fixation (p = 0.07). Mean hospital stay was the same (11 days) in both groups. At three months, mechanical complications involved migration of the cervical screw outside the femoral head for three Targon PF fixations and for two DHS fixations. Screw migration was favored by fracture instability and presence of osteoporosis. There were two deaths in the intramedullary nailing group and one in the screw-plate group. Time to walking was 20 days on average in the intramedullary nailing group and 25 days in the screw-plate group. The mean Harris hip score was 60 in the intramedullary group and 59 in the screw-plate group. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Data in the literature report an advantage for intramedullary nailing, particularly a mechanical advantage, for the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures. Our findings show that good results are obtained with the screw-plate fixation using the DHS with less blood loss and at a lower cost. <EV> <t> Functional outcome in treatment of unstable trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures with the proximal femoral nail and the Medoff sliding plate. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To compare outcome between the proximal femoral nail (PFN) and the Medoff sliding plate (MSP) in patients with unstable trochanteric or subtrochanteric fractures. METHODS: This was a consecutive prospective randomized clinical study. In all, 203 patients admitted to two university hospitals with an unstable trochanteric or a subtrochanteric fracture type were included. Surgery was performed with a short intramedullary nail or a dual-sliding plate device. Follow up visits occurred at 6 weeks, 4 months, and 12 months. Functional outcome was measured by walking ability, rising from a chair, curb test, and additional assessments of abductor strength, pain, living conditions, and complications. RESULTS: The ability to walk 15 m at 6 weeks was significantly better in the PFN group compared to the MSP group with an odds ratio 2.2 (P = 0.04, 95% confidence limits 1.03-4.67). No statistical difference in walking ability could be found between trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. The major complication rate (8% in the PFN group and 4% in the MSP group) did not differ statistically (P = 0.50) but reoperations were more frequent in the PFN group (9%) compared to the MSP group (1%; P < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: There were no major differences in functional outcome or major complications between the treatment groups. Reasons other than the operated fracture seem to be equally important in determining the long-term functional ability of the patients in our study. An advantage with the MSP was the lower reoperation rate. <EV> <t> Pertrochanteric femoral fractures treated with a dynamic hip screw or a proximal femoral nail. A randomised study comparing post-operative rehabilitation. <abs> We treated 108 patients with a pertrochanteric femoral fracture using either the dynamic hip screw or the proximal femoral nail in this prospective, randomised series. We compared walking ability before fracture, intra-operative variables and return to their residence. Patients treated with the proximal femoral nail (n = 42) had regained their pre-operative walking ability significantly (p = 0.04) more often by the four-month review than those treated with the dynamic hip screw (n = 41). Peri-operative or immediate post-operative measures of outcome did not differ between the groups, with the exception of operation time. The dynamic hip screw allowed a significantly greater compression of the fracture during the four-month follow-up, but consolidation of the fracture was comparable between the two groups. Two major losses of reduction were observed in each group, resulting in a total of four revision operations. Our results suggest that the use of the proximal femoral nail may allow a faster post-operative restoration of walking ability, when compared with the dynamic hip screw. <EV> <t> Trochanteric gamma nail and compression hip screw for trochanteric fractures: a randomized, prospective, comparative study in 210 elderly patients with a new design of the gamma nail. <abs> OBJECTIVES: To compare the results between a new intramedullary Gamma nail and a compression hip screw in the treatment of trochanteric fractures. DESIGN: Prospective randomized. SETTING: Level 1 trauma center. PATIENTS: Two hundred ten consecutive patients older than 65 years with trochanteric femoral fractures. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with a compression hip screw or a new design of the Trochanteric Gamma nail (180 mm in length with a mediolateral angle of 4 degrees and available only with a proximal diameter of 17 mm and distal diameter of 11 mm). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Operative and fluoroscopy times, blood loss, functional outcome, complication rate, and failure of fixation. RESULTS: The Trochanteric Gamma nail was used in 104 patients and the compression hip screw in 106. The 2 groups were similar in terms of their preoperative data, with a median follow-up of 13.6 months (range 12-30). The results show no difference in operating time (P = 0.21), but the Trochanteric Gamma nail group had a significantly shorter fluoroscopy time (P = 0.006), and the number of patients transfused and the mean of units of blood transfused were significantly less in the Trochanteric Gamma nail group (P = 0.013, 0.046, respectively). Mortality within 12 months was similar in both groups (P = 0.83). All fractures were radiographically healed at the last visit. There was no difference in intraoperative and postoperative complications or rate of fixation failure between the 2 groups, and no case of secondary shaft fracture of the femur was encountered in this study. In the entire series, there was no difference in the functional outcome (P = 0.74), but the postoperative walking ability was better in those patients with unstable fractures who were treated with the Trochanteric Gamma nail (P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: The new Trochanteric Gamma nail is an effective method for the treatment of trochanteric femoral fractures in elderly patients. The indication for either Trochanteric Gamma nail or compression hip screw is similar in stable fractures, but we recommend the use of the Trochanteric Gamma nail for unstable trochanteric fractures. <EV> <t> The standard Gamma nail or the Medoff sliding plate for unstable trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. A randomised, controlled trial. <abs> We studied 217 patients with an unstable trochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture who had been randomly allocated to treatment by either internal fixation with a standard Gamma nail (SGN) or a Medoff sliding plate (MSP, biaxial dynamisation mode). Their mean age was 84 years (65 to 99) and they were reviewed at four and 12 months after surgery. Assessments of outcome included general complications, technical failures, revision surgery, activities of daily living (ADL), hip function (Charnley score) and the health-related quality of life (HRQOL, EQ-5D). The rate of technical failure in patients with unstable trochanteric fractures was 6.5% (6/93) (including intra-operative femoral fractures) in the SGN group and 5.2% (5/96) in the MSP group. In patients with subtrochanteric fractures, there were no failures in the SGN group (n = 16) and two in the MSP group (n = 12). In the SGN group, there were intra-operative femoral fractures in 2.8% (3/109) and no post-operative fractures. There was a reduced need for revision surgery in the SGN group compared with the MSP group (8.3%; 9/108; p = 0.072). The SGN group also showed a lower incidence of severe general complications (p < 0.05) and a trend towards a lower incidence of wound infections (p = 0.05). There were no differences between the groups regarding the outcome of ADL, hip function or the HRQOL. The reduction in the HRQOL (EQ-5D(index) score) was significant in both groups compared with that before the fracture (p < 0.005). Our findings indicate that the SGN showed good results in both trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. The limited number of intra-operative femoral fractures did not influence the outcome or the need for revision surgery. Moreover, the SGN group had a reduced number of serious general complications and wound infections compared with the MSP group. The MSP in the biaxial dynamisation mode had a low rate of failure in trochanteric fractures but an unacceptably high rate when used in the biaxial dynamisation mode in subtrochanteric fractures. The negative influence of an unstable trochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture on the quality of life was significant regardless of the surgical method.", "summary:reference": "Given the lower complication rate of the SHS in comparison with intramedullary nails, SHS appears superior for trochanteric fractures.

{"document": "<EV> <t> A randomised multicentre trial of integrated versus standard treatment for patients with a first episode of psychotic illness. <abs> OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of integrated treatment for patients with a first episode of psychotic illness. DESIGN: Randomised clinical trial. SETTING: Copenhagen Hospital Corporation and Psychiatric Hospital Aarhus, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 547 patients with first episode of schizophrenia spectrum disorder. INTERVENTIONS: Integrated treatment and standard treatment. The integrated treatment lasted for two years and consisted of assertive community treatment with programmes for family involvement and social skills training. Standard treatment offered contact with a community mental health centre. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Psychotic and negative symptoms (each scored from 0 to a maximum of 5) at one and two years' follow-up. RESULTS: At one year's follow-up, psychotic symptoms changed favourably to a mean of 1.09 (standard deviation 1.27) with an estimated mean difference between groups of -0.31 (95% confidence interval -0.55 to -0.07, P = 0.02) in favour of integrated treatment. Negative symptoms changed favourably with an estimated difference between groups of -0.36 (-0.54 to -0.17, P < 0.001) in favour of integrated treatment. At two years' follow-up the estimated mean difference between groups in psychotic symptoms was -0.32 (-0.58 to -0.06, P = 0.02) and in negative symptoms was -0.45 (-0.67 to -0.22, P < 0.001), both in favour of integrated treatment. Patients who received integrated treatment had significantly less comorbid substance misuse, better adherence to treatment, and more satisfaction with treatment. CONCLUSION: Integrated treatment improved clinical outcome and adherence to treatment. The improvement in clinical outcome was consistent at one year and two year follow-ups. <EV> <t> Randomized, double-blind trial of olanzapine versus placebo in patients prodromally symptomatic for psychosis. <abs> OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the efficacy of olanzapine in delaying or preventing conversion to psychosis and reducing symptoms in people with prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia. METHOD: This randomized trial occurred at four North American clinics in the Prevention Through Risk Identification, Management, and Education project. Outpatients received olanzapine (5-15 mg/day, N=31) or placebo (N=29) during a 1-year double-blind treatment period and no treatment during a 1-year follow-up period. Efficacy measures included the conversion-to-psychosis rate and Scale of Prodromal Symptoms scores. RESULTS: During the treatment year, 16.1% of olanzapine patients and 37.9% of placebo patients experienced a conversion to psychosis, a nearly significant difference. The hazard of conversion among placebo patients was about 2.5 times that among olanzapine-treated patients, which also approached significance. In the follow-up year, the conversion rate did not differ significantly between groups. During treatment, the mean score for prodromal positive symptoms improved more in the olanzapine group than in the placebo group, and the mixed-model repeated-measures least-squares mean score showed significantly greater improvement between weeks 8 and 28 with olanzapine. The olanzapine patients gained significantly more weight (mean=8.79 kg, SD=9.05, versus mean=0.30 kg, SD=4.24). CONCLUSIONS: A significant treatment difference in the conversion-to-psychosis rate was not demonstrated. However, these results may be influenced by low power. The nearly significant differences suggest that olanzapine might reduce the conversion rate and delay onset of psychosis. Olanzapine was efficacious for positive prodromal symptoms but induced weight gain.

There were no significant differences between the CAP and PE groups on cannabis use at end of treatment and 6 months post-intervention. RESULTS: There were no significant group differences on psychopathology and functional ratings at follow-up. A significant reduction in cannabis use was observed for both groups over time. CONCLUSION: PE and specific cannabis-focused intervention are associated with similar reductions in cannabis use in an FEP cohort. Simple interventions may therefore be worth considering prior to intensive psychotherapeutic efforts with this population. <EV> <t> Cognitive therapy for the prevention of psychosis in people at ultra-high risk: randomised controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Advances in the ability to identify people at high risk of developing psychosis have generated interest in the possibility of preventing psychosis. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of cognitive therapy for the prevention of transition to psychosis. METHOD: A randomised controlled trial compared cognitive therapy with treatment as usual in 58 patients at ultra-high risk of developing a first episode of psychosis. Therapy was provided over 6 months, and all patients were monitored on a monthly basis for 12 months. RESULTS: Logistic regression demonstrated that cognitive therapy significantly reduced the likelihood of making progression to psychosis as defined on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale over 12 months. In addition, it significantly reduced the likelihood of being prescribed antipsychotic medication and of meeting criteria for a DSM-IV diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. Analysis of covariance showed that the intervention also significantly improved positive symptoms of psychosis in this population over the 12-month period CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive therapy appears to be an acceptable and efficacious intervention for people at high risk of developing psychosis. <EV> <t> A randomized controlled trial of a brief intervention for families of patients with a first episode of psychosis. <abs> BACKGROUND: Carers' satisfaction with psychiatric services related to information and advice is generally poor. This may be particularly true for services trying to meet the needs of ethnically diverse communities. It is important that services attempt to ameliorate carers' concerns as early as possible. The authors aimed to assess the impact of a brief educational and advice support service on carers of patients with a first episode of psychotic illness. METHOD: Carers of all patients identified with a first episode of psychosis in a defined psychiatric catchment area of North London were invited to participate. Following consent from patients and relatives, relatives were randomly allocated to receive (in addition to usual services) a brief intervention comprising education and advice about the disorder from a support team or to usual care from community psychiatric services. RESULTS: One hundred and six carers were recruited to the study. Take-up of the intervention was less than expected and the intervention had little impact. The authors found no differences over time between the randomized arms for relatives' satisfaction (F = 23, p = 0 .4, df = 1) or number of days spent by patients in hospital over nine months from entry to the trial (F= 1.7, p= 0.18, df = 1). CONCLUSIONS: It was found that the support and advice intervention for families had little impact on their satisfaction or on patients' outcomes. However, failure to take up the intervention threatens the conclusions as the power to show an effect was reduced. Although family interventions, in general, are considered an important adjunct to the treatment of patients with chronic psychosis, there may be difficulties in providing an educational and support intervention shortly after first onset. How and when psychiatric services provide information and advice to carers of people newly diagnosed with a psychosis requires further study. <EV> <t> Interventions in the initial prodromal states of psychosis in Germany: concept and recruitment. <abs> BACKGROUND: The Early Detection and Intervention Programme of the German Research Network on Schizophrenia (GRNS) investigates the initial prodromal phase of psychosis in a multidimensional approach. Two intervention strategies are being studied by two large-scale multicentre projects. AIMS: To present the concept of the intervention studies, and to provide an interim report of the recruitment procedure. METHOD: Comprehensive cognitive-behavioural therapy has been developed for patients in the \"early initial prodromal state\". For patients in the \"late initial prodromal state\" the atypical neuroleptic amisulpride is explored. Both interventions are evaluated in randomised controlled trials using clinical management as the control condition. RESULTS: Between January 2001 and March 2003, 1212 individuals seeking help for mental health problems were screened for putative prodromal symptoms at four university centres. More than 388 individuals fulfilled criteria for both interventions and 188 (48.5%) gave informed consent to participate in the trials. CONCLUSIONS: The screening procedure appears to be feasible and trial participation seems to be acceptable to a relevant proportion of people at increased risk of developing psychosis.", "summary:reference": "We identified insufficient trials to draw any definitive conclusions.

{"document": "<EV> <t> [Delivery in lateral position. Randomized clinical trial comparing the maternal positions in lateral position and dorsal position for the second stage of labour]. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of a maternal position for childbearing, that of lateral decubitus compared with the dorsal decubitus in second phase of parturition, by studying various parameters such as: rate of intact perineum, electronic foetal heart rate monitoring during expulsion, mode of delivery, quantity of maternal blood losses, and neonatal status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The type of study was as follows: prospective, comparative and randomized according to Zelen's design, monocentric, in pragmatic mode and intention to treat. After a review of the literature and a retrospective analysis of the activity of a service (Romans-sur-Isere/France), an assumption of improvement of 15% of the rates of intact perineum in lateral position is put forth. An amount of 562 patients was included and randomized in 2 groups in which the childbirth was carried out in dorsal or lateral decubitus. The data were analysed by software SPSS version 13, by using the tests t of Student, Chi(2) of Pearson or the exact test of Fisher. The analysis relates to 487 patients after exclusion of the distortions to the protocol. RESULTS: We observed a significant increase in the rate of intact perineum, as well as a significant increase in the maternal blood loss, without exceeding the physiological limits, during expulsion in lateral position. The rate of directed delivery was less but more frequent were the haemorrhages in decubitus side. The rate of artificial delivery and/or uterine revision doubled without however reaching the threshold of significativity. Finally, the other parameters did not differ between the two groups. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The test makes it possible to show the improvement of the perineal status during dorsal childbirth in decubitus side compared with the position in decubitus. The data collected prove to be in conformity with those of the literature, which is not very prolix on the subject! The secondary criteria are not improved, and professionals must carry out a reflexion concerning delivery, to adapt the recommendations for the introduction of such practice into a service, must carry out a reflexion. This study provides the scientific basis (NP1), which makes it possible to justify the diffusion of this position of expulsion if one is keen on the improvement of the perineal status. <EV> <t> Child birth in squatting position. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To assess the risks and benefits of squatting position during second stage of labour and its comparison with the supine position. METHODS: The study was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi from 1st January 1999 to 31st January 2000. A total of two hundred patients of similar ante partum, intrapartum and socio-economic conditions were selected. Only patients of gestation more than 37 weeks, presenting in active labour with cephalic presentation were included. Patients with multiple gestation, malpresentation, previous scar, maternal fever and prenatal diagnosed fetal malformation were excluded from the study. Random selection was done after informed consent and alternately divided into two groups A and B. Both groups were ambulatory during first stage of labour. In second stage, group-A adopted the squatting position, while group-B remained supine in lithotomy position. The third stage of labour in both the groups was conducted in the supine position. RESULTS: There was no difference in the application of episiotomies in both groups, however extension of the episiotomy occurred in 7% patients of the non-squatting group (P < 0.05). Para urethral tears occurred in 5% patients in squatting group, but all occurred in patients who were not given an episiotomy. Second degree, and third degree perineal tears occurred in 9% patients in the non-squatting group but none in the squatting group (P < 0.05). Forceps application was also significantly less in group-A 11% and 24% in group-B (P < 0.05).There were two cases of shoulder dystocia in group B but none in the group-A. During the Third stage of labour there were no cases of retained placenta in group A but there were 4% cases of retained placenta and 1% case of postpartum haemorrhage of more than 500 ml due to atony of the uterus in group-B. One patient in the non-squatting position had to have a caesarean section due to persistent occipito posterior position. There was no significant difference in the apgar scores, foetal heart rate patterns or requirement of neonatal resuscitation. CONCLUSION: It appears that squatting position may result in less instrumental deliveries, extension of episiotomies and perineal tears.", "summary:reference": "The findings of this review suggest several possible benefits for upright posture in women without epidural, but with the possibility of increased risk of blood loss greater than 500 mL.

STUDY DESIGN: In a randomized, controlled trial conducted at 3 neonatal units, 70 premature infants with a gestational age 24 to 29 weeks and birth weight < 1200 g were assigned to 1 of 3 feeding methods: continuous nasogastric feeding, intermittent nasogastric feeding, or intermittent orogastric feeding. Feeding was initiated within 30 hours of birth. Daily enteral and parenteral volumes, caloric and protein intakes, growth, enteral intolerance, and clinical complications were recorded. Cox regression analysis was used to determine primary outcome, the time to achieve full enteral feeding. RESULTS: The continuously fed infants achieved full enteral feeding significantly faster than the intermittently fed infants (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07 to 3.22).

{"document": "<EV> <t> Effect of fosinopril in children with steroid-resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. <abs> We aimed to test if fosinopril reduces urinary protein excretion and alleviates renal tubular damage in normotensive children with steroid-resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (SRINS). We also aimed to evaluate whether there are changes in steady-state blood pressure and serum concentrations of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and plasma renin activity or angiotensin II (AT-II) in children under this treatment. Forty-five normotensive patients with SRINS were randomly divided into two groups. Group I was treated with fosinopril and prednisone for 12 weeks, while group II was treated with prednisone alone for the same duration. The values of 24-h urinary protein excretion were 1.25+/-0.64 vs 2.52+/-0.56 g/24 h (P<0.05), 1.16+/-0.45 vs 2.42+/-0.24 g/24 h (P<0.05), and 1.10+/-0.41 vs 2.05+/-0.46 g/24 h (P<0.05) in group I and group II patients, respectively, at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Patients in group I showed lower serum concentrations of urinary retinol-binding protein and beta(2)-microglobulin (P<0.01) at the end of the study, but the patients' blood pressure and components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) had no change during treatment.

Patients in group A ( n=11) received enalapril at low doses for 8 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of washout and then at high doses for 8 weeks. Those in group B ( n=14) initially received enalapril at high and then low doses. Patients continued to receive treatment with tapering doses of prednisolone; none received concomitant therapy with daily oral or intravenous steroids, alkylating agents, cyclosporine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and other antihypertensive medications. The urine albumin-to-creatinine (Ua/Uc) ratio and the percentage reduction were determined for each phase of therapy. Baseline clinical, biochemical, and histological features were comparable in the two groups. In the first phase, treatment with low-dose enalapril (group A) resulted in median 34.8% Ua/Uc reduction compared with 62.9% with high doses (group B) ( P<0.01). High-dose enalapril was associated with a significant reduction in Ua/Uc ratio in both groups. The combined median Ua/Uc (95% confidence interval) reduction in the low-dose phase was 33% (-10.3% to 72.4%) and in the high-dose 52% (15.4%-70.4%) ( P<0.05). The median Ua/Uc ratio at the end of 20 weeks was 1.1 and 1.8 in groups A and B, respectively ( P>0.05). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions were similar in both groups.

METHODS: This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adjunctive ZNS in 351 patients with refractory partial seizures receiving a stable regimen of one to three antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Patients were randomized to placebo or ZNS, 100 mg, 300 mg, or 500 mg/day (2:1:1:2) after a 12-week baseline. Dose titration was undertaken over a 6-week titration phase, which was followed by an 18-week fixed-dose assessment phase. Primary efficacy parameters were the differences between ZNS, 500 mg/day, and placebo in the change from baseline in frequency of complex partial (CP) seizures during the fixed-dose assessment phase and in the proportion of CP responders (> or =50% decrease from baseline in seizure frequency). Safety and tolerability also were assessed. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, the highest dose of ZNS (500 mg/day) resulted in a significantly greater decrease in CP seizure frequency from baseline (51.2% vs. 16.3%; p < 0.0001) and a significantly higher proportion of CP responders (52.3% vs. 21.3%; p < 0.001). Both ZNS, 500 mg/day, and 300 mg/day were statistically superior to placebo in reducing the frequency of \"all seizures\" and simple partial (SP) + CP seizures.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Norfloxacin vs ceftriaxone in the prophylaxis of infections in patients with advanced cirrhosis and hemorrhage. <abs> BACKGROUND & AIMS: Oral norfloxacin is the standard of therapy in the prophylaxis of bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage. However, during the last years, the epidemiology of bacterial infections in cirrhosis has changed, with a higher incidence of infections caused by quinolone-resistant bacteria. This randomized controlled trial was aimed to compare oral norfloxacin vs intravenous ceftriaxone in the prophylaxis of bacterial infection in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. METHODS: One hundred eleven patients with advanced cirrhosis (at least 2 of the following: ascites, severe malnutrition, encephalopathy, or bilirubin >3 mg/dL) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were randomly treated with oral norfloxacin (400 mg twice daily; n = 57) or intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g/day; n = 54) for 7 days. The end point of the trial was the prevention of bacterial infections within 10 days after inclusion. RESULTS: Clinical data were comparable between groups. The probability of developing proved or possible infections, proved infections, and spontaneous bacteremia or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was significantly higher in patients receiving norfloxacin (33% vs 11%, P = .003; 26% vs 11%, P = .03; and 12% vs 2%, P = .03, respectively). The type of antibiotic used (norfloxacin), transfusion requirements at inclusion, and failure to control bleeding were independent predictors of infection. Seven gram-negative bacilli were isolated in the norfloxacin group, and 6 were quinolone resistant. Non-enterococcal streptococci were only isolated in the norfloxacin group. No difference in hospital mortality was observed between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous ceftriaxone is more effective than oral norfloxacin in the prophylaxis of bacterial infections in patients with advanced cirrhosis and hemorrhage. <EV> <t> [Prospective randomized trial of intravenous ciprofloxacin for prevention of bacterial infection in cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleeding]. <abs> BACKGROUND/AIMS: In cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleeding, bacterial infections are a frequent complication. Oral antibiotic prophylaxis decreases the incidence of bacterial infections. The administration of oral antibiotics, however, may be difficult in some cirrhotic patients with active bleeding. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics for the prevention of bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleeding. METHODS: From December 1998 to September 2001, a total of 40 consecutive cirrhotic patients with Child-Pugh class B or C were enrolled after emergent endoscopic esophageal variceal ligation (EVL) was taken because of esophageal variceal bleeding. Enrolled patients were randomized into a treatment group and a control group. The treatment group (n=20) received the intravenous ciprofloxacin 200mg IV q 12 hours for 3 days while the control group(n=20) didn,t. RESULTS: Bacterial infection developed in nine patients (45%) of the control group and only two patients (10%) in the treatment group. The incidence of bacterial infections was significantly lower in the treatment group than the control group (p < 0.005). The hospital cost and length of hospital stay decreased in the treatment group compared with the control group (p < 0.001). There were no differences in the hospital course and mortality within 30 days between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding and with Child-Pugh class B or C, the use of intravenous ciprofloxacin for 3 days after EVL was not only effective in the prevention of bacterial infections but also cost-effective. <EV> <t> Prophylactic antibiotics in cirrhotics with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage: a prospective, controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Infections are a frequent complication in cirrhotics, and gastrointestinal bleeding may increase the infection rate. Nonabsorbable antibiotics or quinolone have been employed to decrease the incidence of infection. Since most of these studies were performed in western countries, it is still unclear whether this holds true in our Taiwan cirrhotic patients. Thus we conducted this study using a different formula of antibiotics to evaluate the efficacy of reducing infection rates in cirrhotics with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. METHODS: From July 1999 to August 2000, all cirrhotic in-patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding but without infection were enrolled. The patients should not have received antibiotics within 2 weeks before admission and should have expected life expectance more than 7 days. Eligible patients who had received endoscopy within 12 hours of hospitalization were randomly allocated into 2 groups. Group A received intravenous cefazolin 1 gm every 8 hours started before endoscopy. After 3 days of prophylactic parenteral antibiotics, antibiotics were shifted to oral cephalexin of 500 mg every 6 hours for 4 days. Group B served as control subjects. All patients received chest X-ray, blood and urine cultures, and ascites culture and sputum culture if ascites and sputum were found. Patients were excluded when initial blood, urine or ascites culture was positive for bacterial growth. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were included. Group A was comprised of 47 patients and Group B comprised of 50 patients. There was no significant difference in age, sex, Child-Pugh's score or initial hemoglobin between the 2 groups. Proved infection developed in 6 patients of Group B. By contrast, no proved infection was found in Group A. Three organisms belonged to gram-negative bacilli and 3 organisms were gram-positive cocci. The incidence of proved infection during hospitalization was 0% in Group A and 12.0% in Group B (p = 0.027). If possible infection cases (patient's body temperature more than 38 degrees C for more than 2 days) were included, the infection rate was 6.4% in Group A and 26% in Group B (p = 0.013). Infection-related mortality occurred in 2 patients in Group B, but none in Group A. CONCLUSIONS: Our prophylactic antibiotic treatment proved safe and effective in reducing the infection rate in cirrhotics with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. <EV> <t> Variceal bleeding in portal hypertension: bacterial infection and comparison of efficacy of intravenous and per-oral application of antibiotics--a randomized trial. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of bacterial infection in patients admitted to hospital with variceal bleeding in comparison with patients with liver cirrhosis admitted because of another reason. To compare the effect of orally administered antibiotics vs. intravenous antibiotics. METHODS: Bacteriological investigation of blood culture, urine, throat smear, perianal smear and ascites (polymorphonuclear count as well in ascites) was made in 46 cirrhotic patients admitted to hospital with variceal bleeding and 48 cirrhotic patients admitted because of another reason. Bleeders were treated endoscopically (sclerotization) and pharmacologically (terlipressin 1 mg every 4 h for 5 days), and were randomly allocated to the treatment with oral norfloxacin (25 patients) or intravenous ampicillin/sulbactam (21 patients). Early and late mortalities were evaluated. RESULTS: The incidence of infection was high in both groups (63.0% bleeders vs. 54.2% controls), but bleeding patients more often had positive blood culture (17.3% vs. 8.6%) and statistically significantly more positive findings in the throat smears (36.9% vs. 17.3%, P=0.04), which gives the evidence of increased pathological colonization in these patients. No difference in survival was seen in patients with per-oral or intravenous administration of antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection was demonstrated in high percentage in patients with liver cirrhosis admitted to hospital. The administration of antibiotics is indicated in these patients. Intravenous application is probably of the same efficacy as per-oral one. <EV> <t> Antibiotic prophylaxis using third generation cephalosporins can reduce the risk of early rebleeding in the first acute gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage: a prospective randomized study. <abs> Bacterial infection may be a critical trigger for variceal bleeding. Antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent rebleeding in patients with acute gastroesophageal variceal bleeding (GEVB). The aim of the study was to compare prophylactic third generation cephalosporins with on-demand antibiotics for the prevention of gastroesophageal variceal rebleeding. In a prospective trial, patients with the first acute GEVB were randomly assigned to receive prophylactic antibiotics (intravenous cefotaxime 2 g q 8 hr for 7 days, prophylactic antibiotics group) or to receive the same antibiotics only when infection became evident (on-demand group). Sixty-two patients in the prophylactic group and 58 patients in the on-demand group were included for analysis. Antibiotic prophylaxis decreased infection (3.2% vs. 15.5%, p=0.026). The actuarial rebleeding rate in the prophylactic group was significantly lower than that in the on-demand group (33.9% vs. 62.1%, p=0.004). The difference of rebleeding rate was mostly due to early rebleeding within 6 weeks (4.8% vs. 20.7%, p=0.012). On multivariate analysis, antibiotic prophylaxis (relative hazard: 0.248, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.067-0.919, p=0.037) and bacterial infection (relative hazard: 3.901, 95% CI: 1.053-14.448, p=0.042) were two independent determinants of early rebleeding. In conclusion, antibiotic prophylaxis using third generation cephalosporins can prevent bacterial infection and early rebleeding in patients with the first acute GEVB. <EV> <t> Antibiotic prophylaxis after endoscopic therapy prevents rebleeding in acute variceal hemorrhage: a randomized trial. <abs> Bacterial infection may adversely affect the hemostasis of patients with gastroesophageal variceal bleeding (GEVB). Antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent bacterial infection in such patients, but its role in preventing rebleeding is unclear. Over a 25-month period, patients with acute GEVB but without evidence of bacterial infection were randomized to receive prophylactic antibiotics (ofloxacin 200 mg i.v. q12h for 2 days followed by oral ofloxacin 200 mg q12h for 5 days) or receive antibiotics only when infection became evident (on-demand group). Endoscopic therapy for the GEVB was performed immediately after infection work-up and randomization. Fifty-nine patients in the prophylactic group and 61 patients in the on-demand group were analyzed. Clinical and endoscopic characteristics of the gastroesophageal varices, time to endoscopic treatment, and period of follow-up were not different between the two groups. Antibiotic prophylaxis decreased infections (2/59 vs. 16/61; P <.002). The actuarial probability of rebleeding was higher in patients without prophylactic antibiotics (P =.0029). The difference of rebleeding was mostly due to early rebleeding within 7 days (4/12 vs. 21/27, P =.0221). The relative hazard of rebleeding within 7 days was 5.078 (95% CI: 1.854-13.908, P <.0001). The multivariate Cox regression indicated bacterial infection (relative hazard: 3.85, 95% CI: 1.85-13.90) and association with hepatocellular carcinoma (relative hazard: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.30-4.63) as independent factors predictive of rebleeding. Blood transfusion for rebleeding was also reduced in the prophylactic group (1.40 +/- 0.89 vs. 2.81 +/- 2.29 units, P <.05). There was no difference in survival between the two groups. In conclusion, antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent infection and rebleeding as well as decrease the amount of blood transfused for patients with acute GEVB following endoscopic treatment.", "summary:reference": "Prophylactic antibiotic use in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding significantly reduced bacterial infections, and seems to have reduced all-cause mortality, bacterial infection mortality, rebleeding events, and hospitalisation length.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Mechanical bowel preparation or not? Outcome of a multicenter, randomized trial in elective open colon surgery. <abs> PURPOSE: Mechanical bowel preparation is common practice in elective colon surgery. In recent literature the value of this procedure is under discussion. To verify the value of mechanical bowel preparation in elective open colon surgery, a randomized clinical trial was conducted. METHODS: During a prospective, multicenter, randomized study, 250 patients undergoing elective open colon surgery were randomized between receiving mechanical bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol (PEG group, 125 patients) and having a normal meal preoperatively (normal meal preoperatively group, 125 patients). Outcome parameters were wound infection with bacterial results of intraoperative swabs and anastomotic leak. RESULTS: In the polyethylene glycol group there were a total of nine wound infections (7.2 percent) and seven anastomotic leaks (5.6 percent) compared with seven wound infections (5.6 percent) (P = 0.61) and six anastomotic leaks (4.8 percent) (P = 0.78) in the normal meal preoperatively group. Bacterial results showed 52 percent sterile subcutis swabs in the PEG group and 63 percent sterile subcutis swabs in the normal meal preoperatively group (P = 0.11). CONCLUSION: In the present study we could not detect a difference in outcome parameters between patients receiving mechanical bowel preparation in elective open colon surgery and patients without preoperative treatment of the bowel. The present study, although underpowered, did not show a difference in the primary outcome of bacterial wound cultures between patients receiving preoperative mechanical bowel preparation and patients receiving no preoperative bowel treatment. We conclude that there may be no need to continue the use of mechanical bowel preparation in elective open colon surgery. <EV> <t> Mechanical bowel preparation for elective colorectal surgery: a multicentre randomised trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Mechanical bowel preparation is a common practice before elective colorectal surgery. We aimed to compare the rate of anastomotic leakage after elective colorectal resections and primary anastomoses between patients who did or did not have mechanical bowel preparation. METHODS: We did a multicentre randomised non-inferiority study at 13 hospitals. We randomly assigned 1431 patients who were going to have elective colorectal surgery to either receive mechanical bowel preparation or not. Patients who did not have mechanical bowel preparation had a normal meal on the day before the operation. Those who did were given a fluid diet, and mechanical bowel preparation with either polyethylene glycol or sodium phosphate. The primary endpoint was anastomotic leakage, and the study was designed to test the hypothesis that patients who are given mechanical bowel preparation before colorectal surgery do not have a lower risk of anastomotic leakage than those who are not. The median follow-up was 24 days (IQR 17-34). We analysed patients who were treated as per protocol. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00288496. FINDINGS: 77 patients were excluded: 46 who did not have a bowel resection; 21 because of missing outcome data; and 10 who withdrew, cancelled, or were excluded for other reasons. The rate of anastomotic leakage did not differ between both groups: 32/670 (4.8%) patients who had mechanical bowel preparation and 37/684 (5.4%) in those who did not (difference 0.6%, 95% CI -1.7% to 2.9%, p=0.69). Patients who had mechanical bowel preparation had fewer abscesses after anastomotic leakage than those who did not (2/670 [0.3%] vs 17/684 [2.5%], p=0.001). Other septic complications, fascia dehiscence, and mortality did not differ between groups. INTERPRETATION: We advise that mechanical bowel preparation before elective colorectal surgery can safely be abandoned. <EV> <t> Randomized clinical trial of mechanical bowel preparation versus no preparation before elective left-sided colorectal surgery. <abs> BACKGROUND: Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) is performed routinely before colorectal surgery to reduce the risk of postoperative infectious complications. The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to compare the outcome of patients who underwent elective left-sided colorectal surgery with or without MBP. METHODS: Patients scheduled for elective left-sided colorectal resection with primary anastomosis were randomized to preoperative MBP (3 litres of polyethylene glycol) (group 1) or surgery without MBP (group 2). Postoperative abdominal infectious complications and extra-abdominal morbidity were recorded prospectively. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-three patients were included in the study, 78 in group 1 and 75 in group 2. Demographic, clinical and treatment characteristics did not differ significantly between the two groups. The overall rate of abdominal infectious complications (anastomotic leak, intra-abdominal abscess, peritonitis and wound infection) was 22 per cent in group 1 and 8 per cent in group 2 (P = 0.028). Anastomotic leak occurred in five patients (6 per cent) in group 1 and one (1 per cent) in group 2 (P = 0.210) [corrected] Extra-abdominal morbidity rates were 24 and 11 per cent respectively (P = 0.034). Hospital stay was longer for patients who had MBP (mean(s.d.) 14.9(13.1) versus 9.9(3.8) days; P = 0.024). CONCLUSION: Elective left-sided colorectal surgery without MBP is safe and is associated with reduced postoperative morbidity. <EV> <t> Randomized clinical trial of bowel preparation with a single phosphate enema or polyethylene glycol before elective colorectal surgery. <abs> BACKGROUND: A recent meta-analysis has questioned the value of bowel preparation in patients undergoing colorectal resection. The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate whether a single phosphate enema was as effective as oral polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution in preventing anastomotic leakage. METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive either a single phosphate enema or 3 litres of oral PEG solution before surgery. Patients were followed for a minimum of 6 weeks to detect anastomotic leakage. RESULTS: There were 147 patients in each group and the groups were evenly matched for putative risk factors at baseline. Patients in the enema group had more anastomotic leaks requiring reoperation than those in the PEG group (4.1 versus 0 per cent, P = 0.013; relative risk 2.04 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 1.82 to 2.30)). The mortality rate was higher in the PEG group (2.7 versus 0.7 per cent, P = 0.176; odds ratio 1.62 (95 per cent c.i. 0.45 to 36.98)). CONCLUSION: Bowel preparation with a phosphate enema was associated with an increased risk of anastomotic leakage requiring reoperation compared with oral PEG. These results do not support the routine use of a phosphate enema in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. <EV> <t> Is mechanical bowel preparation mandatory for elective colon surgery? A prospective randomized study. <abs> BACKGROUND: Bowel preparation prior to colonic surgery usually includes antibiotic therapy together with mechanical bowel preparation (MBP). Mechanical bowel preparation may cause discomfort to the patient, prolonged hospitalization, and water and electrolyte imbalance. It was assumed that with the improvement in surgical technique together with the use of more effective prophylactic antibiotics, it was possible that MBP would no longer be necessary. HYPOTHESIS: There is no statistical difference in the postoperative results of patients who undergo elective colon resection with MBP as compared with those who have no MBP. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: The study includes all patients who had elective large bowel resection at Campus Golda between April 1, 1999, and March 31, 2002. Emergency operations were not included. The patients were randomly assigned to the 2 study groups (with or without MBP) according to identification numbers. All patients were treated with intravenous and oral antibiotics prior to surgery. The patients in the MBP group received Soffodex for bowel preparation. RESULTS: A total of 329 patients participated in the study, 165 without MBP and 164 with MBP. The 2 groups were similar in age, sex, and type of surgical procedure. Two hundred sixty-eight patients (81.5%) underwent surgery owing to colorectal cancer and 61 patients (18.5%) owing to benign disease. The hospitalization period was longer in the bowel-prepared group (mean +/- SD, 8.2 +/- 5.1 days) as compared with the nonprepared group (mean +/- SD, 8.0 +/- 2.7 days). However, this difference was not statistically significant. The time until the first bowel movement was similar between the 2 groups: a mean +/- SD of 4.2 +/- 1.3 days in the nonprepared group as compared with a mean +/- SD of 4.3 +/- 1.1 days in the prepared group (P = NS). Four patients (1.2%) died in the postoperative course owing to acute myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. Sixty-two patients (37.6%) of the non-MBP group suffered from postoperative complications as compared with 77 patients (46.9%) of the MBP group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that no advantage is gained by preoperative MBP in elective colorectal surgery. <EV> <t> Mechanical bowel preparation for elective colorectal surgery with primary intraperitoneal anastomosis by a single surgeon: interim analysis of a prospective single-blinded randomized trial. <abs> We report an interim analysis of a prospective single-blinded randomized trial designed to investigate whether preoperative mechanical bowel preparation influences the rate of surgical-site infection and anastomotic failure after elective colorectal surgery with primary intraperitoneal anastomosis performed by a single surgeon. Patients scheduled to undergo an elective colorectal procedure with a primary intraperitoneal anastomosis were randomized to receive either oral polyethylene glycol lavage solution and enemas (group A) or no preparation (group B). Surgical-site infection and anastomotic failure were investigated. Of 97 patients included, 48 were assigned to group A and 49 to group B. Twelve (12.4%) developed wound infections, six in each group (12.5 vs. 12.2%; NS). Intra-abdominal sepsis was only seen in group A (n = 3, 6.3%). Anastomotic failure occurred in four patients in group A (8.3%) vs. two patients in group B (4.1%) (NS). The overall complication rate in group A was 27.1%, vs. 16.3% in group B. The number needed to harm was 9.3. Our interim analysis of a prospective single-blinded randomized trial suggests that a surgeon may have the same or even worse outcomes when mechanical bowel preparation is routinely used for colorectal surgery with primary intraperitoneal anastomosis. <EV> <t> Multicentre randomized clinical trial of mechanical bowel preparation in elective colonic resection. <abs> BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that MBP does not lower the risk of postoperative septic complications after elective colorectal surgery. This randomized clinical trial assessed whether preoperative MBP is beneficial in elective colonic surgery. METHODS: A total of 1505 patients, aged 18-85 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists grades I-III, were randomized to MBP or no MBP before open elective surgery for cancer, adenoma or diverticular disease of the colon. Primary endpoints were cardiovascular, general infectious and surgical-site complications within 30 days, and secondary endpoints were death and reoperations within 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 1343 patients were evaluated, 686 randomized to MBP and 657 to no MBP. There were no significant differences in overall complications between the two groups: cardiovascular complications occurred in 5.1 and 4.6 per cent respectively, general infectious complications in 7.9 and 6.8 per cent, and surgical-site complications in 15.1 and 16.1 per cent. At least one complication was recorded in 24.5 per cent of patients who had MBP and 23.7 per cent who did not. CONCLUSION: MBP does not lower the complication rate and can be omitted before elective colonic resection.

The study did not reveal any significant beneficial effect of laser zona thinning on clinical pregnancy (16 out of 45 vs. 18 out of 39) and live birth rates (13 out of 45 vs. 16 out of 39) between the laser-treated and nontreated groups of patients, although there was a trend toward an increased incidence of dichorionic multiple pregnancies in the study group compared with the control group (7 out of 13 vs. 4 out of 16). <EV> <t> Mechanically expanding the zona pellucida of human frozen thawed embryos: a new method of assisted hatching. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a new assisted hatching (AH) method increases the implantation and clinical pregnancy rates of frozen-thawed day-3 (D3) embryos. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: A university hospital in vitro fertilization (IVF) program. PATIENT(S): Patients who had their first IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles between June 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008, with fresh IVF-embryo transfer failures or without fresh embryo transfer. INTERVENTION(S): The couples were randomized into thawed embryo transfer after AH versus no AH. In the AH group, the zona pellucida (ZP) of D3 frozen-thawed embryos was expanded by injected hydrostatic pressure after thawing. In the control group, embryos were pierced by ICSI needles without expanding the ZP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Clinical pregnancy and implantation rates. RESULT(S): The morphologic features of the blastomeres were carefully monitored and recorded. In the AH group, 244 embryos were thawed, and 178 (73.0%) survived; in the control group, 259 embryos were thawed, and 190 (73.4%) survived. Despite the transfer of a similar number of embryos, the AH group resulted in statistically significantly higher implantation and clinical pregnancy rates compared with the no AH group. CONCLUSION(S): Mechanically expanding the ZP of frozen-thawed D3 embryos with injected hydrostatic pressure after thawing increases the implantation rate compared with control embryos. <EV> <t> A prospective, randomized, double-blinded study of assisted hatching in women younger than 38 years undergoing in vitro fertilization. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To determine whether assisted hatching is beneficial to IVF patients younger than 38 years whose embryos have a thickened zona pellucida (ZP). DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blinded, crossover study. SETTING: University-based infertility center. PATIENT(S): One hundred twenty-one women less than 38 years of age, undergoing IVF at Washington University between April 2004 and February 2007, with ZP thickness > or =13 microm for any embryos. INTERVENTION(S): Measurement of ZP thickness in embryos undergoing IVF; randomization of women with embryos with ZP thickness > or =13 microm to no procedure or assisted hatching performed by acidic Tyrode's solution. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Clinical intrauterine pregnancy rate, implantation rate, spontaneous pregnancy loss, and live birth rate. RESULT(S): Baseline characteristics and ZP thickness were not significantly different between the two study arms (hatched and unhatched). No significant differences were observed between hatched and unhatched patients in the rates of clinical pregnancy (47% vs. 50% respectively) or live birth (46% vs. 45% respectively). Further, no significant differences were noted between hatched and unhatched groups in rates of spontaneous abortions, monozygotic twinning, dizygotic twinning, chromosomal abnormalities, or ectopic gestations. In addition, mean ZP thickness did not have a significant effect on pregnancy. CONCLUSION(S): In patients younger than 38 years with embryos with ZP thickness of > or =13 microm, assisted hatching does not improve the rates of implantation, clinical pregnancy, or live birth, and thus does not appear to offer any benefit to patients in this age group undergoing IVF. <EV> <t> Effect of laser zona thinning on vitrified-warmed embryo transfer at the cleavage stage: a prospective, randomized study. <abs> The aim of this study was to determine if laser zona thinning could improve the rates of pregnancy and implantation for vitrified-warmed embryo transfer at the cleavage stage. A total of 400 vitrified-warmed embryo transfer cycles were randomly assigned to either the test group or the control group. The zona pellucida of vitrified-warmed embryos in the patients of the control group was untreated, whereas in the test group it was partially thinned by laser just before embryo transfer. In the test group, the clinical pregnancy and implantation rates were significantly lower as compared with that of the control group (28.5 versus 43.0, P=0.002, and 11.2 versus 16.7, P=0.004, respectively).

The effects of intravascular volume replacement regimens on liver function secondary to alteration of the postoperative inflammatory response are not known. In this study, we evaluated the effects of different volume replacement regimens in hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing hepatectomy to clarify whether albumin administration can be replaced by other volume replacement products. METHODS: Ninety consecutive hepatocellular carcinoma patients scheduled for hepatectomy were prospectively randomized to receive 20% human albumin (HA), 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) or lactated Ringer's solution (LR) for postoperative volume replacement. Hemodynamic, liver function and inflammatory response parameters were recorded on postoperative days one, three, and five throughout the investigation period. RESULTS: Significantly less volume was required in the HA and the HES groups. Although patients in all groups had similar baseline values, the plasma osmolality was significantly higher in the HA and HES groups. Total bilirubin (TB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased from baseline in all groups, and did not differ significantly between groups. C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly lower in the HES group compared with the other groups.

We also assessed the impact of this intervention on the exclusivity of human milk feeding. METHODS: Human milk-fed (> or = 80% feeding per day) low birth weight (750-1800 g) infants (n = 39) were randomly assigned at hospital discharge to either a control or an intervention group. Infants in the control group were discharged from the hospital on unfortified human milk. Nutrient enrichment of human milk in the intervention group was achieved by mixing approximately one half of the human milk provided each day with a powdered multinutrient human milk fortifier for 12 weeks after discharge. Milk with added nutrients was estimated to contain approximately 80 kcal (336 kJ) and 2.2 g protein/100 mL plus other nutrients. Intensive lactation support was provided to both groups. RESULTS: Infants in the intervention group were longer during the study period, and those born < or = 1250 g had larger head circumferences than infants in the control group. There was a trend toward infants in the intervention group to be heavier at the end of the intervention compared with those in the control group.

CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest that adding a multinutrient fortifier to approximately one half of the milk provided to predominantly human milk-fed infants for 12 weeks after hospital discharge may be an effective strategy in addressing early discharge nutrient deficits and poor growth without unduly influencing human milk feeding when intensive lactation support is provided.", "summary:reference": "The limited available data suggest that feeding preterm infants following hospital discharge with multinutrient fortified breast milk compared with unfortified breast milk increases growth rates during infancy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of compression elastic stockings for prevention of the post-thrombotic syndrome in patients with proximal DVT. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled clinical trial. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: 180 consecutive patients with a first episode of symptomatic proximal DVT who received conventional anticoagulant treatment. INTERVENTIONS: Before discharge, patients were randomly assigned to wear or not wear below-knee compression elastic stockings (30 to 40 mm Hg at the ankle) for 2 years. Follow-up was performed for up to 5 years. MEASUREMENTS: The presence and severity of the post-thrombotic syndrome were scored by using a standardized scale. RESULTS: Post-thrombotic sequelae developed in 44 of 90 controls (severe in 10) and in 23 of 90 patients wearing elastic stockings (severe in 3). All but 1 event developed in the first 2 years.

{"document": "<EV> <t> Treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with etanercept: an exploratory, placebo-controlled trial. <abs> RATIONALE: An efficacious medical therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains elusive. OBJECTIVES: To explore the efficacy and safety of etanercept in the treatment of IPF. METHODS: This was a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter exploratory trial in subjects with clinically progressive IPF. Primary endpoints included changes in the percentage of predicted FVC and lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide corrected for hemoglobin (Dl(CO(Hb))) and change in the alveolar to arterial oxygen pressure difference P(a-a)(O(2)) at rest from baseline over 48 weeks. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eighty-eight subjects received subcutaneous etanercept (25 mg) or placebo twice weekly as their sole treatment for IPF. No differences in baseline demographics and disease status were detected between treatment groups; the mean time from first diagnosis was 13.6 months and mean FVC was 63.9% of predicted. At 48 weeks, no significant differences in efficacy endpoints were observed between the groups. A nonsignificant reduction in disease progression was seen in several physiologic, functional, and quality-of-life endpoints among subjects receiving etanercept. There was no difference in adverse events between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory study in patients with clinically progressive IPF, etanercept was well tolerated. Although there were no differences in the predefined endpoints, a decreased rate of disease progression was observed on several measures. Further evaluation of TNF antagonists in the treatment of IPF may be warranted. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 00063869). <EV> <t> Anticoagulant therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. <abs> STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of anticoagulant therapy on the survival of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Five hospitals located in the Miyagi prefecture in Japan, including a university hospital, a Red Cross hospital, two public general hospitals, and a municipal hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-six patients with IPF (mean age, 69.4 years; range, 47 to 89) admitted to the hospitals from April 2001 to April 2004. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assigned to receive prednisolone alone or prednisolone plus anticoagulant therapy. The anticoagulants included oral warfarin in an outpatient setting and low-molecular-weight heparin for rehospitalized patients with severely progressive respiratory failure. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: There was no difference in baseline characteristics, including age, gender, clinical condition, pulmonary function, and plasma d-dimer level between the non-anticoagulant group and the anticoagulant group. The overall survival and hospitalization-free periods were assessed. There was a significant difference between survival curves of the non-anticoagulant group and the anticoagulant group, with a 2.9 hazard ratio (p = 0.04, Cox regression model). There was no significant difference in the probability of a hospitalization-free period between groups. The major cause of clinical deterioration was acute exacerbation during follow-up in the present study. Therefore, the mortality and plasma d-dimer levels in patients with an acute exacerbation were also assessed. The mortality associated with acute exacerbations of IPF in the anticoagulant group was significantly reduced compared to that in the non-anticoagulant group (18% vs 71%, respectively; p = 0.008, Fisher Exact Test). Furthermore, the plasma d-dimer levels in patients who died were significantly higher than those in survivors during acute exacerbation of IPF (3.3 +/- 2.3 microg/mL vs 0.9 +/- 0.7 microg/mL, p < 0.0001). Histologic analysis performed in three patients who died due to an exacerbation of IPF in the non-anticoagulant group demonstrated the features of usual interstitial pneumonia and acute lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that plasma d-dimer levels are associated with mortality in patients with an acute exacerbation of IPF, and that anticoagulant therapy has a beneficial effect on survival in patients with IPF. <EV> <t> BUILD-1: a randomized placebo-controlled trial of bosentan in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. <abs> RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal lung disease lacking effective treatment. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of bosentan on exercise capacity and time to disease progression in patients with IPF. METHODS: In a double-blind, multicenter trial, patients with IPF were randomized to receive oral bosentan 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, increased to 125 mg twice daily thereafter, or placebo, for 12 months or longer. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline up to Month 12 in exercise capacity, as measured by a modified six-minute-walk test. Secondary endpoints were time to death or disease progression (worsening pulmonary function tests [PFTs] or acute decompensation), change in PFT scores, and quality of life (QOL) assessed using Short-Form 36 and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 158 patients randomly received bosentan (n = 74) or placebo (n = 84). Bosentan showed no superiority over placebo in six-minute-walk distance (6MWD) up to Month 12, the primary efficacy endpoint. A trend in favor of bosentan was observed in the secondary endpoint of time to death or disease progression (hazard ratio [HR], 0.613; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.328-1.144; P = 0.119), which was more pronounced in a patient subgroup diagnosed using surgical lung biopsy (post hoc analysis; HR, 0.315; 95% CI, 0.126-0.789; P = 0.009). Changes from baseline up to Month 12 in assessments of dyspnea and QOL favored treatment with bosentan. No unexpected adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Bosentan treatment in patients with IPF did not show superiority over placebo on 6MWD. A trend in delayed time to death or disease progression, and improvement in QOL, was observed with bosentan. The more pronounced treatment effect in patients with biopsy-proven IPF warrants further investigation. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 00071461). <EV> <t> High-dose acetylcysteine in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. <abs> BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic progressive disorder with a poor prognosis. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study that assessed the effectiveness over one year of a high oral dose of acetylcysteine (600 mg three times daily) added to standard therapy with prednisone plus azathioprine. The primary end points were changes between baseline and month 12 in vital capacity and in single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DL(CO)). RESULTS: A total of 182 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (92 to acetylcysteine and 90 to placebo). Of these patients, 155 (80 assigned to acetylcysteine and 75 to placebo) had usual interstitial pneumonia, as confirmed by high-resolution computed tomography and histologic findings reviewed by expert committees, and did not withdraw consent before the start of treatment. Fifty-seven of the 80 patients taking acetylcysteine (71 percent) and 51 of the 75 patients taking placebo (68 percent) completed one year of treatment. Acetylcysteine slowed the deterioration of vital capacity and DL(CO): at 12 months, the absolute differences in the change from baseline between patients taking acetylcysteine and those taking placebo were 0.18 liter (95 percent confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.32), or a relative difference of 9 percent, for vital capacity (P=0.02), and 0.75 mmol per minute per kilopascal (95 percent confidence interval, 0.27 to 1.23), or 24 percent, for DL(CO) (P=0.003). Mortality during the study was 9 percent among patients taking acetylcysteine and 11 percent among those taking placebo (P=0.69). There were no significant differences in the type or severity of adverse events between patients taking acetylcysteine and those taking placebo, except for a significantly lower rate of myelotoxic effects in the group taking acetylcysteine (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with acetylcysteine at a dose of 600 mg three times daily, added to prednisone and azathioprine, preserves vital capacity and DL(CO) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis better than does standard therapy alone. <EV> <t> Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pirfenidone in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. <abs> Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disorder without an effective therapy to date. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 107 patients were prospectively evaluated for efficacy of a novel compound, pirfenidone. The difference in the change in the lowest oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) during a 6-minute exercise test, the primary endpoint, from baseline to 6 months was not significant between the two groups (p = 0.0722). In a prespecified subset of patients who maintained a SpO2 greater than 80% during a 6-minute exercise test at baseline, the lowest SpO2 improved during a 6-minute exercise test in the pirfenidone group at 6 and 9 months (p = 0.0069 and 0.0305, respectively). Positive treatment effect was demonstrated in secondary endpoints: (1) change in VC measurements at 9 months (p = 0.0366) and (2) episodes of acute exacerbation of IPF occurring exclusively in the placebo group during the 9 months (p = 0.0031). Significant adverse events were associated with pirfenidone; however, adherence to treatment regimen was similar between pirfenidone and placebo groups. In conclusion, treatment with pirfenidone improved VC and prevented acute exacerbation of IPF during the 9 months of follow-up. Future long-term studies are needed to clarify the overall safety and efficacy of pirfenidone in IPF. <EV> <t> A placebo-controlled trial of interferon gamma-1b in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. <abs> BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive, fatal disease with no known efficacious therapy. METHODS: In a double-blind, multinational trial, we randomly assigned 330 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis that was unresponsive to corticosteroid therapy to receive subcutaneous interferon gamma-1b or placebo. RESULTS: Over a median of 58 weeks, interferon gamma-1b therapy did not significantly affect the primary end point of progression-free survival, defined as the time to disease progression or death, and no significant treatment effect was observed on measures of lung function, gas exchange, or the quality of life. Ten percent of patients in the interferon gamma-1b group died, as compared with 17 percent of patients in the placebo group (P=0.08). Treatment with interferon gamma-1b was associated with more frequent constitutional symptoms. However, the rates of treatment adherence and premature discontinuation of treatment were similar in the two groups. More pneumonias were reported among patients in the interferon gamma-1b group, but the incidence of severe or life-threatening respiratory tract infections was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In a well-defined population of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, interferon gamma-1b did not affect progression-free survival, pulmonary function, or the quality of life. Owing to the size and duration of the trial, a clinically significant survival benefit could not be ruled out. <EV> <t> Effect of interferon gamma-1b on survival in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (INSPIRE): a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a fatal disease for which no effective treatment exists. We assessed whether treatment with interferon gamma-1b improved survival compared with placebo in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and mild-to-moderate impairment of pulmonary function. METHODS: 826 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were enrolled from 81 centres in seven European countries, the USA, and Canada. Patients were randomly assigned (double-blind) in a 2:1 ratio to receive 200 microg interferon gamma-1b (n=551) or equivalent placebo (n=275) subcutaneously, three times per week. Eligible patients were aged 40-79 years, had been diagnosed in the past 48 months, had a forced vital capacity of 55-90% of the predicted value, and a haemoglobin-corrected carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of 35-90% of the predicted value. The primary endpoint was overall survival time from randomisation measured at the second interim analysis, when the proportion of deaths had reached 75% of those expected by the study conclusion. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00075998. FINDINGS: At the second interim analysis, the hazard ratio for mortality in patients on interferon gamma-1b showed absence of minimum benefit compared with placebo (1.15, 95% CI 0.77-1.71, p=0.497), and indicated that the study should be stopped. After a median duration of 64 weeks (IQR 41-84) on treatment, 80 (15%) patients on interferon gamma-1b and 35 (13%) on placebo had died. Almost all patients reported at least one adverse event, and more patients on interferon gamma-1b group had constitutional signs and symptoms (influenza-like illness, fatigue, fever, and chills) than did those on placebo. Occurrence of serious adverse events (eg, pneumonia, respiratory failure) was similar for both treatment groups. Treatment adherence was good and few patients discontinued treatment prematurely in either group. INTERPRETATION: We cannot recommend treatment with interferon gamma-1b since the drug did not improve survival for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which refutes previous findings from subgroup analyses of survival in studies of patients with mild-to-moderate physiological impairment of pulmonary function. FUNDING: InterMune. <EV> <t> Imatinib treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Randomized placebo-controlled trial results. <abs> RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease with no known efficacious therapy. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potential efficacy to treat fibrotic lung disease. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the safety and clinical effects of imatinib in patients with IPF. METHODS: We studied 119 patients in an investigator-initiated, multicenter, multinational, double-blind clinical trial to receive imatinib or placebo for 96 weeks. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Over 96 weeks of follow-up, imatinib did not differ significantly from placebo (log rank P = 0.89) for the primary endpoint defined as time to disease progression (10% decline in percent predicted FVC from baseline) or time to death. There was no effect of imatinib therapy on change in FVC at 48, 72, or 96 weeks (P > or = 0.39 at all time points) or change in diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide at 48, 72, or 96 weeks (P > or = 0.26 at all time points). Change in resting Pa(O(2)) favored imatinib therapy at 48 weeks (P = 0.005) but not at 96 weeks (P = 0.074). During the 96-week trial there were 8 deaths in the imatinib group and 10 deaths in the placebo group (log rank test P = 0.64). Thirty-five (29%) patients discontinued the study without reaching the primary endpoint (imatinib, 32%; placebo, 27%; P = 0.51). Serious adverse events (SAEs) were not more common in the imatinib group (imatinib, 18 SAEs in 17 patients; placebo, 19 SAEs in 18 patients).

A multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised phase III clinical trial was conducted in Japanese patients with well-defined IPF to determine the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone, a novel antifibrotic oral agent, over 52 weeks. Of 275 patients randomised (high-dose, 1,800 mg x day(-1); low-dose, 1,200 mg x day(-1); or placebo groups in the ratio 2:1:2), 267 patients were evaluated for the efficacy of pirfenidone. Prior to unblinding, the primary end-point was revised; the change in vital capacity (VC) was assessed at week 52. Secondary end-points included the progression-free survival (PFS) time. Significant differences were observed in VC decline (primary end-point) between the placebo group (-0.16 L) and the high-dose group (-0.09 L) (p = 0.0416); differences between the two groups (p = 0.0280) were also observed in the PFS (the secondary end-point). Although photosensitivity, a well-established side-effect of pirfenidone, was the major adverse event in this study, it was mild in severity in most of the patients.

The PREDICT study aimed to compare remission rates in patients with CIDP treated with high-dose dexamethasone with rates in patients treated with standard oral prednisolone. METHODS: In eight neuromuscular centres in the Netherlands and one in the UK, patients aged 18 years or older who had newly diagnosed definite or probable CIDP were randomly assigned to a treatment regimen of either pulsed high-dose dexamethasone or standard oral prednisolone. Randomisation was done with a random number generator. The primary outcome measure was remission at 12 months, defined as improvement of at least three points on the Rivermead mobility index and improvement of at least one point on the inflammatory neuropathy cause and treatment disability scale. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN07779236. FINDINGS: Between December, 2003, and December, 2008, 40 patients were treated: 24 received dexamethasone and 16 received prednisolone. At 12 months, 16 patients were in remission: ten in the dexamethasone group and six in the prednisolone group (odds ratio [OR] 1.2, 95% CI 0.3-4.4). Most adverse events were minor and did not differ substantially between treatment groups; however, sleeplessness and Cushing's face occurred more often in the prednisolone group. INTERPRETATION: Pulsed high-dose dexamethasone treatment did not induce remission more often than prednisolone treatment. A substantial proportion of patients were in remission at 12 months in both treatment groups.

Changes were assessed in weight, blood pressure and resting heart rate, HbA(1c), fasting glucose, and lipids. RESULTS: Sibutramine induced significant weight loss (P < 0.001) with both 15 mg/day (5.5 +/- 0.6 kg at 12 months) and 20 mg/day (8.0 +/- 0.9 kg), whereas placebo did not (0.2 +/- 0.5 kg). Weight loss > or = 10% was achieved by 14 and 27% of subjects receiving 15 and 20 mg, respectively, but by none given placebo. Glycemic control improved in parallel with weight loss, and subjects who lost > or = 10% weight showed significant decreases in both HbA(1c) (1.2 +/- 0.4%, P < 0.0001) and fasting plasma glucose (1.8 mmol/l, P < 0.001). HDL cholesterol increased slightly with the higher dose, whereas plasma triglycerides fell with both doses, especially in subjects with weight loss of > or = 10% (a 29% decrease, P < 0.01). Treatment was generally well tolerated. Sibutramine treatment raised sitting diastolic blood pressure by > or = 5 mmHg in a higher proportion of patients than did placebo (43% with 15 mg/day vs. 25% with placebo, P < 0.05), but this effect was less evident in subjects who had a weight loss of > or = 10% weight. Pulse rate increased significantly more with sibutramine, being > or = 10 bpm higher in 42% of treated patients versus 17% with placebo (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Sibutramine can be an effective adjunct to metformin treatment in selected obese type 2 diabetic subjects and improves metabolic control in individuals who lose weight. <EV> <t> Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of the action of orlistat, fluvastatin, or both an anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and lipid profile in obese patients with hypercholesterolemia prescribed a standardized diet. <abs> OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess obese patients with hypercholesterolemia whom were prescribed a standardized diet, comparing the action of orlistat, fluvastatin, orlistat with fluvastatin, and placebo on anthropometric measurements, blood pressure (BP), and lipid profile. METHODS: This was a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The patients were prescribed a controlled-energy diet and were randomly allocated to receive placebo, orlistat 120 mg TID (O group), fluvastatin 80 mg/d (F group), or olistat 120 mg TID with fluvastatin 80 mg/d (OF group). Clinical measurements (body weight, body mass index [BMI], waist circumference, and BP) and lipid profile assessment (total cholesterol [TC], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], and triglycerides [TGs]) were performed at baseline and after 6 months and 1 year of treatment. RESULTS: The study included 99 obese patients with hypercholesterolemia (48 men and 51 women; mean [SD] age, 51 [9] years). There were no significant differences between groups in baseline demographic, BP, or plasma lipid values. Three patients dropped out (2 women in the O group and 1 man in the OF group) due to adverse events related to orlistat treatment, including gastrointestinal events (oily spotting and fecal urgency). Ninety-six patients completed the study. There were significant differences from baseline (mean [SD]) in BMI, waist circumference reduction (WCR), and body weight loss (BWL) at 6 months in the OF group (29.9 [1.1] kg/m(2), 2.7 [0.8] cm, and 7.4 [0.9] kg, respectively; all P < 0.05), and BMI, WCR, and BWL at 1 year in the O group (29.0 [1.0] kg/m(2), 3.0 [1.0] cm, and 8.6 [1.0] kg, respectively; all P < 0.02), the F group (29.3 [1.6] kg/m(2), 2.4 [1.0] cm, and 8/0 [1.0] kg, respectively; all P < 0.05), and the OF group (28.4 [0.6] kg/m(2), 4.0 [0.6] cm, and 11.4 [1.0] kg, respectively; all P < 0.01). Significant reductions from baseline in systolic and diastolic BP were observed at 1 year in the O and F groups (all P < 0.05) and the OF group (both P < 0.01). At 6 months, there were significant reductions from baseline in TC and LDL-C in the F group (both P < 0.05) and in TC, LDL-C, and TGs in the OF group (P < 0.02, P < 0.02, and P < 0.05, respectively), as well as a significant increase in HDL-C in the OF group (P < 0.02). At 1 year, there were significant reduction from baseline in TC in the O, F, and OF groups (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively), LDL-C (P < 0.05, P < 0.02, and P < 0.01, respectively), and TGs (P < 0.02, P < 0.05, and P < 0.02, respectively). Also at 1 year, HDL-C was significantly higher than baseline in the F and OF groups (P < 0.02 and P < 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Improvements in clinical and lipid-profile parameters were found at 1 year with all 3 treatments. <EV> <t> Use of sibutramine in overweight adult hispanic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. <abs> BACKGROUND: The management of type 2 diabetes mellitus is complicated by the presence of risk factors related to overweight and obesity, particularly visceral adiposity. However, weight loss and weight maintenance are difficult for patients with diabetes, and the benefits of dietary modifications are typically modest. Sibutramine is a serotonin- and norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitor that reduces food intake by inducing early satiety and attenuates the decrease in basal energy expenditure associated with weight loss. Previous trials of sibutramine in overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes have shown significant weight loss accompanied by better glycemic control. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the effect on body weight and glycemic control of sibutramine in combination with glibenclamide in obese Hispanic patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This was a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted at the Endocrinology Service, General Hospital of Mexico, Mexico City. Included were overweight or obese (body mass index [BMI] >27 kg/M2) patients with type 2 diabetes between the ages of 24 and 65 years who had been receiving glibenclamide monotherapy for at least 2 weeks and whose glucose concentrations were stable. Patients were randomized to receive sibutramine 10 mg or placebo once daily. The primary efficacy measures were change in body weight, waist circumference, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Anthropometrics and fasting glucose concentrations were measured monthly. HbA1c was determined at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Laboratory parameters were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were randomized to receive sibutramine (28 women, 16 men; mean [SD] age, 47.6 [9.0] years), and 42 were randomized to receive placebo (31 women, 11 men; mean age, 45.8 [8.1] years). Twenty-four patients in the sibutramine group and 23 in the placebo group completed the trial. In the sibutramine group, body weight was reduced from a mean (SD) of 73.9 (10.3) kg at baseline to 69.8 (10.6) kg at month 12; BMI decreased from 29.9 (2.6) to 28.2 (2.9) kg/M2; waist circumference was reduced from 94.9 (8.4) to 90.8 (8.4) cm; the plasma fasting glucose concentration decreased from 140.4 (29.4) to 114.2 (32.0) mg/dL; and the HbA1c value was reduced from 8.9% (1.2) to 8.3% (1.2) (all, P < 0.001). In the placebo group, the corresponding changes were from 74.5 (10.3) kg at baseline to 73.1 (11.2) kg at month 12; from 30.1 (2.5) to 29.5 (2.9) kg/M2; from 94.4 (7.3) to 93.1 (8.3) cm (P < 0.05); from 140.7 (25.2) to 123.9 (38.3) mg/dL (P < 0.05); and from 9.0% (1.2) to 9.1% (1.3). In the sibutramine group, weight loss continued for up to 12 months. CONCLUSION: In this population of obese Hispanic patients with type 2 diabetes, sibutramine combined with glibenclamide therapy achieved weight loss for up to 12 months and was associated with better glycemic control than placebo. <EV> <t> Weight reduction and long-term maintenance after 18 months treatment with orlistat for obesity. <abs> OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of orlistat on weight reduction and the long-term maintenance of this weight loss when associated with a continuous mildly reduced energy diet. DESIGN: A multicenter, 18-month, double-blind study conducted in 81 hospital centers. Patients were randomized to orlistat 120 mg or placebo three times daily in conjunction with a mildly reduced-energy diet maintained throughout the study. SUBJECTS: In total, 696 otherwise healthy, overweight patients aged 18-65 y (BMI >or=28 kg/m(2)) were randomized to treatment with orlistat (n=346) or placebo (n=350). MEASUREMENTS: Body weight, anthropometry, lipid and glycemic control parameters and blood pressure. RESULTS: After 18 months, patients treated with orlistat lost significantly more body weight compared with placebo (-6.5+/-0.8 vs -3.0+/-0.8%; P=0.0005). After 12 months, 32.9% of orlistat vs 24.5% of placebo patients lost >or=10% of their initial weight (P=0.04). A significantly greater number of patients receiving orlistat treatment maintained this >or=10% weight loss compared to those receiving placebo (28.1 vs 13.8%; P<0.0001). Compared with placebo, orlistat was associated with a greater decrease in fasting blood glucose (-0.86+/-0.12 vs -0.29+/-0.18 mmol/l; P<0.05) and LDL-cholesterol (-13.0+/-1.3 vs -7.0+/-1.3%; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: A clinically meaningful reduction in body weight and the maintenance of this weight loss is achievable with orlistat treatment and dietary restriction over a period of 18 months. This weight loss resulted in an improvement in risk factors for coronary heart disease. <EV> <t> Health-related quality of life in a randomised placebo-controlled trial of sibutramine in obese patients with type II diabetes. <abs> OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effects of 12-month treatment with sibutramine 15 mg daily compared with placebo on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in obese type II diabetes patients. We examined the associations between the changes in HRQL and in weight, glycaemic control, and haemodynamic variables. We also explored the predictive value of HRQL and its changes early during treatment. DESIGN: A randomised clinical trial. The subjects were enrolled in a 2-week single-blind run-in period with a modestly hypocaloric diet (700 kcal daily deficit) and then randomised to receive either sibutramine 15 mg (n=114, 60% female) or placebo (n=122, 58% female) once daily with the hypocaloric diet for 12 months. SUBJECTS: Obese (mean BMI 36 kg/m(2) and age 54 y) type II diabetes patients untreated with antidiabetic medications. MEASUREMENTS: The main outcome measures included body weight and HRQL (the RAND 36-Item Health Survey 1.0). RESULTS: The mean weight loss was greater in the sibutramine group (-7.1 kg) than in the placebo group (-2.6 kg, P<0.001). The baseline HRQL was relatively high. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in glycaemic control or in any of the RAND-36 scales during the study. The scores on physical functioning (PF) and health change (HC) since last year improved in both groups and this improvement was related to weight loss. When HRQL changes were examined in categories of weight loss, the scores on PF and HC increased with >/=5% weight loss, but the scores on vitality (V) and general health (GH) increased only after >/=15% weight loss. Decrease in HbA1c was associated with increases in the scores of PF, GH, V, mental health, and HC. In the sibutramine group, the increase in diastolic blood pressure was associated with the decrease in the scores of PF, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning (ERF), social functioning (SF), and bodily pain. High baseline scores on ERF and SF, and low scores on V predicted weight loss at 12 months. Also, increasing scores on PF and V during the first 3 months predicted weight loss at 12 months. The sum of four dichotomised HRQL variables (baseline ERF >/=75=1 and <75=0; baseline SF>/=80=1 and <80=0; 3-month change in PF>0=1 and </=0=0; 3-month change in V>0=1 and </=0=0) predicted weight loss: In the group with sum 0, the mean(s.d.) weight change at 12 months was 0.0(2.6)% and with sum 4 it was -9.0(8.1)% of baseline weight. CONCLUSION: Despite the superior weight loss, sibutramine 15 mg daily did not produce HRQL benefits over placebo when measured with the generic RAND-36 in obese type II diabetes patients. PF and HC since last year improved with >/=5% weight loss, but >/=15% weight loss was needed to achieve a cluster of HRQL improvements. The decrease in HbA1c was associated with many HRQL benefits. Poor baseline HRQL and the improvement observed in the first months of treatment may prove to be useful in predicting success in long-term weight loss. <EV> <t> XENical in the prevention of diabetes in obese subjects (XENDOS) study: a randomized study of orlistat as an adjunct to lifestyle changes for the prevention of type 2 diabetes in obese patients. <abs> OBJECTIVE: It is well established that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is closely linked to the presence and duration of overweight and obesity. A reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle changes has previously been demonstrated. We hypothesized that adding a weight-reducing agent to lifestyle changes may lead to an even greater decrease in body weight, and thus the incidence of type 2 diabetes, in obese patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a 4-year, double-blind, prospective study, we randomized 3,305 patients to lifestyle changes plus either orlistat 120 mg or placebo, three times daily. Participants had a BMI >/=30 kg/m2 and normal (79%) or impaired (21%) glucose tolerance (IGT). Primary endpoints were time to onset of type 2 diabetes and change in body weight. Analyses were by intention to treat. RESULTS: Of orlistat-treated patients, 52% completed treatment compared with 34% of placebo recipients (P < 0.0001). After 4 years' treatment, the cumulative incidence of diabetes was 9.0% with placebo and 6.2% with orlistat, corresponding to a risk reduction of 37.3% (P = 0.0032). Exploratory analyses indicated that the preventive effect was explained by the difference in subjects with IGT. Mean weight loss after 4 years was significantly greater with orlistat (5.8 vs. 3.0 kg with placebo; P < 0.001) and similar between orlistat recipients with impaired (5.7 kg) or normal glucose tolerance (NGT) (5.8 kg) at baseline. A second analysis in which the baseline weights of subjects who dropped out of the study was carried forward also demonstrated greater weight loss in the orlistat group (3.6 vs. 1.4 kg; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with lifestyle changes alone, orlistat plus lifestyle changes resulted in a greater reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes over 4 years and produced greater weight loss in a clinically representative obese population. Difference in diabetes incidence was detectable only in the IGT subgroup; weight loss was similar in subjects with IGT or NGT [correction]. <EV> <t> Weight reduction by sibutramine in obese subjects in primary care medicine: the SAT Study. <abs> BACKGROUND: Sibutramine is a selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor that is known to reduce body weight. The efficacy of this drug in primary care medicine is currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: To study, in a primary healthcare setting, the effect of a standardized non-pharmacological treatment program and 15 mg sibutramine or placebo on long-term weight reduction in obese subjects with a body mass index >or= 30 and < 40 kg/m(2). DESIGN: A multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel group comparison over 54 weeks of continuous therapy. SETTING: 33 general practitioners in Germany. SUBJECTS: 389 obese patients were recruited of whom 362 were randomized. MEASUREMENTS: Primary measure was weight reduction at week 54; others included reduction in BMI, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure and blood lipids. RESULTS: 348 obese subjects were analyzed using an intention-to-treat analysis. Mean weight loss in the sibutramine (S) group was 8.1 +/- 8.2 kg vs. 5.1 +/- 6.5 kg in the placebo (P) group (p < 0.001; Intent-to-treat analysis). More subjects lost more than 5 % and 10 % of initial weight with sibutramine than with placebo (5 %, S: 62.6 %, P: 41.4 %, p < 0.001; 10 %, S: 40.8, P: 19.0 %, p < 0.001). Weight loss was accompanied by an improvement in the lipid profile, in particular, an increase in HDL-cholesterol and a decrease in fasting triglycerides. In both groups, systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased in those with moderate hypertension and remained unchanged in those with normal blood pressure at baseline. There was a modest increase in heart rate in S (1.9 beats/min) vs. P (- 0.9 beats/min) (p < 0.05).

It has been suggested that antihypertensive therapy may reduce the risk of stroke, despite possibly increasing the risk of death. METHODS: We randomly assigned 3845 patients from Europe, China, Australasia, and Tunisia who were 80 years of age or older and had a sustained systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or more to receive either the diuretic indapamide (sustained release, 1.5 mg) or matching placebo. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor perindopril (2 or 4 mg), or matching placebo, was added if necessary to achieve the target blood pressure of 150/80 mm Hg. The primary end point was fatal or nonfatal stroke. RESULTS: The active-treatment group (1933 patients) and the placebo group (1912 patients) were well matched (mean age, 83.6 years; mean blood pressure while sitting, 173.0/90.8 mm Hg); 11.8% had a history of cardiovascular disease. Median follow-up was 1.8 years. At 2 years, the mean blood pressure while sitting was 15.0/6.1 mm Hg lower in the active-treatment group than in the placebo group. In an intention-to-treat analysis, active treatment was associated with a 30% reduction in the rate of fatal or nonfatal stroke (95% confidence interval [CI], -1 to 51; P=0.06), a 39% reduction in the rate of death from stroke (95% CI, 1 to 62; P=0.05), a 21% reduction in the rate of death from any cause (95% CI, 4 to 35; P=0.02), a 23% reduction in the rate of death from cardiovascular causes (95% CI, -1 to 40; P=0.06), and a 64% reduction in the rate of heart failure (95% CI, 42 to 78; P<0.001). Fewer serious adverse events were reported in the active-treatment group (358, vs. 448 in the placebo group; P=0.001).
